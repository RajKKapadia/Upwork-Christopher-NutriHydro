PREFACE  
Hydroponics has a dedicated following worldwide; of both amateur and commercial growers. This book, 
though titled  
- Commercial - , is still very much a relevant reference for the amateur.  
Over the 20 years since we published the first edition, Hydroponics has become a significant and stable 
facet of horticulture in  
many countries. It has been recognised for its environmental as well as commercial benefits; and an 
ever increasing variety of  
techniques and applications have emerged. Organic hydroponics is e ven possible today.  
Hydroponics offers more than anything else, possibilities for plant culture that did not exist before. In a 
hydroponic system, many  
of the manual tasks, and costs involved in soil culture can be eliminated, but there is a trade off. Th e set 
up costs are normally  
higher. Hydroponics can make better use of limited water resources, and can reduce or eliminate the 
need for chemical pest control in a  
commercial situation. Hydroponic produce can in fact be less tainted by chemical residues than produce 
from a traditional farm.  
I was asked to write the first edition of this book in 1988 by David Rosenberg, founder of Kangaroo 
Press. Despite being a  
relatively new branch of Horticulture, there were already plenty of hydroponic books on the market 
around the world. There was one  
thing that was still scarce in most books: information about different types of plants and how to grow 
them in hydroponics. A  
significant part of the original book was devoted to this plant information. With assistance from my staff 
at Australian Correspondence  
Schools we surveyed leading hydroponic experts and growers, interviewing them over the phone. We 
asked them about how to   
grow 87 different plants in hydroponics and then documented the results.  
Over the 20 years that the first edition was in print, it has been printed nine times, making it an 
exceptionally successful book,  
particularly being of such a specialist nature.  
I wish to thank all of those who have purchased and used the first editions, and I trust the second 
edition will be even more useful to you.  The second edition saw us talking again with experts, and gathering information from literature to 
expand and update  every  
part of the book, but in particular, plant cultural information.  
This third edition has been produced as an e -book; in response to the changing nature of publishing 
worldwide. It is an all new  
layout, with some additional changes.  
With this new el ectronic format, we have been given tools to make further editions and changes 
whenever we want. It is our  
intention to review the book and add further information periodically as we move forward into the 
future.  
This book has come together with a great d eal of support and assistance from a large number of people 
over many years, as you  
will see in the acknowledgements. I wish to sincerely thank everyone who has assisted me.  
I hope you find the reading both enjoyable and useful.

 CHAPTER 1 : INTRODUCTION   
 
 
 
Hydroponics is the technique of growing plants  
without soil. The roots grow either in air,   
which is kept very humid; in water, which is  
well aerated; or in some solid, non -soil  
medium, which is kept moist. The water around  
the roots contains a carefully balanced mixture  
of nutrients which provides food for the plant.  
There are three main w ays of growing plants hydroponically:  
 
Aggregate culture  
Small particles of chemically inert substances provide a suitable  
environment for the plant roots to grow through.  
 
Rockwool culture  
A fibrous sponge -like material made from molten rock  
provides an  environment for the roots to grow through.  
 
Water culture  
Water, perhaps mixed with air (with no solid material),  
provides the environment in which the roots grow.  
The aggregate, rockwool or water which is used to provide the  root environment, supplies the physical needs of the roots.  
The roots (and in fact the whole plant) also have chemical needs  
which must be catered to. The chemical needs are supplied by  
adding a carefully calculated solution of nutrients to the root  
zone, and maintaining the balance of chemicals in that  
solution at appropriate levels.  
Hydroponics has also been called - soilless culture - ,  
- nutriculture -  and - chemiculture - . 
 
 
HISTORY  
The word hydroponics comes from two Greek words:  
hydro meaning wa ter and ponos meaning labour. This  
word was first used by Dr W.F. Gericke, a Californian  
professor who in 1929 began to develop what had  
previously been a laboratory technique into a commercial  
means of growing plants. Throughout the 19th Century a  
number of scientists undertook significant research into the  
nature of plant nutrition. Classical experiments conducted by  
German plant scientists, Sachs in 1860 and Knop  
between 1861 and 1865, led to our first understanding  
of what were essential plant nutrients. Chemical formulae  
developed by Sachs and Knop, and several other researchers  
who followed them, provided Dr Gericke with the knowledge  
to make an effective nutrient solution, thus overcoming the  
major restriction to the development of hydrop onic culture.  
Plants had been grown hydroponically before Dr Gericke,  
but only as laboratory experiments or (in the case of some  
earlier civilisations) without a proper understanding of  the methods being used. Dr Gericke is credited with having  
recognised the commercial potential of what he had seen as  
a laboratory technique, and having conducted trials which  
inspired the development of a commercial industry in the  
following decades.  
Scientists in North America, Europe and Japan, inspired by  
Dr Gericke - s experiences, worked throughout the 1930s and  
40s to refine our knowledge of hydroponic growing. The  
United States army used hydroponic culture to grow fresh  
food for troops statio ned on infertile Pacific Islands during  
World War II. By the 1950s there were viable commercial  
hydroponic farms operating in America, Britain, Europe,  
Africa and Asia.  
Interest in hydroponics developed in Australia  
throughout the 1960s, and in the 197 0s many vegetable  
growers, inspired by tales of increased production,  
attempted to convert their operations to hydroponics.  
Unfortunately many of these people failed to do their  
- homework - , and embarked upon schemes without having a  
real understandi ng of the differences between soil and  
hydroponic culture. The result was many failures, and the  
development of an attitude in Australia that hydroponics  
doesn - t really work.  
In 1981 CSR Ltd established an Australian plant to produce  
horticultural gra de rockwool for hydroponic production.  
CSR did their homework, promoted their product well  
and supported it with excellent technical information. As a  
result, Growool (as it is known) became widely accepted,  
and today is used extensively in the Austral ian cut f lower  industry.  
At the beginning of the 21st century commercial crops of  
vegetables, berry fruit, and cut f lowers are grown  
extensively by hydroponic culture in many countries. The  
most popular technique worldwide is rockwool culture,  
though NFT (Nutrient Film Technique), perlite and gravel  
bed culture are all very significant techniques in use in  
commercial hydroponics.  
 
 
HOW PLANTS GROW  
To understand and practice hydroponics suc cessfully requires  
the grower to have an understanding of how plants grow.  
Almost all plants grown in hydroponics are f lowering plants.  
These plants have four main parts:  
Roots  -   the parts which grow below the soil  
Stems  -  the framework  
Leaves  -  required for respiration, transpiration  
and photosynthesis  
Reproductive parts -  f lowers and fruits.  
 
Roots  
Soil provides the plant with the following:  
-  Nutrients  
-  Water  
-  Air 
-  Support  
Roots absorb nutrients, water and gasses, transmitting these  
- chemicals -  to feed other parts of the plant. Roots hold the plant in  position and stop it from falling over or blowing away.  
When we grow a plant in hydroponics, we must make sure that  
nutrients, water and air are still supplied and that the plant is  
supported, as would occur if it was growing in soil.  
Nutrient supply in soil is a more complex matter than in  
hydroponics. Plant nutrients can be supplied, broadly  
speaking, in three diff erent forms:  
Water soluble simple chemical compounds  
Nutrients in these compounds are readily available to plants  
(i.e. the plant can absorb them quickly and easily).  
Less soluble simple chemical compounds  
The nutrients in these compounds can be used by p lants without  
needing to undergo any chemical change, but because they don - t  
dissolve so easily in water they aren - t as readily usable as the  
more soluble compounds. The diminished solubility may be  
because of the nature of the compound (e.g. superph osphate)  
or may be due to something else (e.g. slow -release fertilisers  
such as Osmocote, which is made by incorporating the simple  
chemicals inside a semi - permeable bubble -  thus nutrients move  
slowly out of the bubble).  
This second group of nutrien ts, when placed in soil, will last  
longer than the first group of water soluble nutrients.  
Complex chemical compounds  
These require chemical changes to occur before the nutrients  
can be absorbed by plants. They include organic manures and  
fertilisers wh ich need to be broken down by the soil  
microorganisms into a form which they can use. They also  
include other complex fertilisers which need to be affected by  
natural acids in the soil, or heat from the sun, to become simple  compounds which the plant roots can use.  
 
 
Complex chemicals release their nutrients gradually over a  
long period of time, depending on the range of chemical  
changes needed to take place before the plant can use  
them.  
Plants grown in a soil derive their  nutrients from all three  
types of compounds. The availability of these compounds  
varies not only according to the group they come from but  
also with factors such as heat, water, soil acids and  
microorganisms present. Consequently it is impossible to  
control the availability of nutrients in soil.  
This is one intrinsic advantage of hydroponics over soil  
growing. In hydroponics you can choose to use only simple,  
soluble compounds, and so you can determine the exact  
amount of each essential nutrient av ailable to a plant at  
any point in time.  
 
Stems  
The main stem and its branches are the framework that  
support the leaves, f lowers and fruits. The leaves, and also  
green stems, manufacture food by the process known as  
photosynthesis, and this is transp orted to the f lowers, fruits  
and roots. The vascular system within the stem consists  
of canals, or vessels, which transfer nutrients and water  
upwards and downwards through the plant. This is  
equivalent to the blood system in animals.  
 Leaves  
The primary function of leaves is photosynthesis, a process  
in which light energy is caught from the sun and stored via a  
chemical reaction in the form of carbohydrates such as  
sugars. The energy can then be retrieved and used at a  
later date if requir ed in a process known as respiration.  
Leaves are also the principle plant part involved in the  
process known as transpiration whereby water evaporating,  
mainly through leaf pores (or stomata), sometimes through  
the leaf surface (or cuticle) as well, pa sses out of the leaf into  
a drier external environment. This evaporating water helps  
regulate the temperature of the plant. This process may also  
operate in the reverse direction whereby water vapour from  
a humid external environment will pass into the  drier leaf.  
The process of water evaporating from the leaves is very  
important in that it creates a water gradient or potential  
between the upper and lower parts of the plant. As the  
water evaporates from the plant cells in the leaves then  
more water is drawn from neighbouring cells to replace  
the lost water. Water is then drawn into those neighbouring  
cells from their neighbours and from conducting vessels in  
the stems. This process continues, eventually drawing  
water into the roots from the groun d until the water  
gradient has been sufficiently reduced. As the water  
moves throughout the plant it carries nutrients, hormones,  
enzymes, etc. In effect this passage of water through the  
plant has a similar effect to a water pump, in this case  
causin g water to be drawn from the ground, through the  
plant, and eventually out into the atmosphere.   
 
Reproductive parts  
Almost all plants grown in hydroponics are f lowering plants.  
These reproduce by pollen (i.e. male parts) fertilising an egg (i.e.  
female part found in the ovary of a f lower). The ovary then  
grows to produce a fruit and the fertilised egg(s) will grow  
to produce seed.  
There can sometimes be difficulty in obtainin g a good crop  
because insufficient pollen reaches the female parts, resulting in  
insufficient fruit forming. (This is discussed in chapter 11.)  
 
 
CLASSIFICATION  
OF HYDROPONIC SYSTEMS  
There are two main groups of systems:  
 
Water culture  
Nutrients are diss olved in water which is brought in  
contact with the roots. Water is either aerated or roots are  
allowed to contact air as well as nutrient solution.  
Trellis, wire mesh or some other support is provided  
above the nutrient solution  
Examples  
Nutrient  
tank  
Standard  
jar 
Nutrient film  (NFT) Mist  
systems  
Aggregate culture  
Nutrients are dissolved in water which is moved into  
the root area. The roots are grown in a solid, inert (nutrient - 
free) material, which is able to hold sufficient moisture but  
drain off the excess, allowing adequate aeration. The solid  
material which the roots grow in contributes towards (if  
not fully supplying) anchorage.  
Examples  
Beds and tier systems.  
 
The Varia bles of a System  
The types of hydroponic system that can be used vary for  
a range of reasons. The most common variables are:  
1. Solution   dispensation   -closed  or  open   (i.e. 
 the solution  is recycled  or drained   through  and lost)  
-drip, slop, capillary feed, wicks, misting, dry fertilising etc.  
2. Automatic or manual operation  
3. Type of medium -gravel, vermiculite, perlite, sand,  
scoria, peat, expanded clay, a mixture etc.  
4. Construction materials -concrete, fibreglass, plastic,  
glass, wood, masonry,  metal, PVC, ceramic, polystyrene,  
etc. 
5. Rate and frequency of irrigation and feeding  
6. Air injection (in water culture, where air is pumped into  
nutrient solution to raise the oxygen level)  
7. Plant support -trellis etc.  
8. Environmental controls -temperature, ventilation etc.   
 
OVERVIEW OF THE INDUSTRY  
Commercial hydroponics is a successful and rapidly expanding  
industry. Industry growth has been particularly dramatic in  
the last decade. In the early 1990s there were around 5000  
hectares of commercial hydroponic production worldwide. By  
2001 there were an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 hectares under  
hydroponic production, and this strong growth in global  
commercial produc tion is expected to continue over the next  
few years.1  
Commercial production is centred in affluent countries with  
discerning customers -  The Netherlands, Spain, Canada, UK, US,  
Australia, NZ, Italy and Japan. The major producer is  
Holland, with aroun d 10,000 hectares under production,  
followed by Spain, Canada and France. Australia is ranked as the  
tenth major producer in the world, and the leading producer of  
fancy lettuce. Expansion in the US has been slower; in 1998  
the US ranked as the sixteen th largest producer, although a  
recent surge in large commercial installations is likely to boost  
their production. 2  
Although, as this book shows, many crops can be grown  
successfully in hydroponics, worldwide commercial production  
is limited to a few  crops: tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce,  
capsicums and cut f lowers (including roses, gerberas,  
carnations, chrysanthemums and lisianthus).  
In most countries the majority of hydroponic crops are grown in  
greenhouses, the exception being Australia where mor e than  
50% of hydroponic production takes place outdoors (due to the  high proportion of lettuce grown). In Holland nearly all  
greenhouses have converted to rockwool and NFT culture as a  
consequence of soil depletion, salinisation, a build -up of soil - 
borne diseases, high water tables and good economic returns.  
The most popular systems worldwide are NFT and rockwool  
culture, although other systems are used for commercial  
production. In a ll countries systems are moving towards  
recirculation, due to the potential environmental problems  
caused by run -to-waste systems.  
Other sustainable practices such as - organic hydroponics -   
(chapter 4) and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are seen to  
be important strategies for future production. Currently more  
than 70% of Dutch hydroponic production relies on IPM (for  
tomatoes and capsicums it is more than 90%).3  
 
 
WHY PRACTICE HYDROPONICS -  
Hydroponics has been practiced by market gardeners and  
other growers since the 1940s. The advantages of  
hydroponics are many; however, the disadvantages should  
not be overlooked when you are deciding whether or  
not to set up a hydroponics system.  
 
Advantages  
1. You can grow anywhere  
Crops can be grown where n o suitable soil exists or  
where the soil is contaminated with disease.  
2. Culture is intensive  
A lot can be grown in a small space, over a short period  of time. It is also possible to grow in multi -levels. Where  
transportation costs to the market are significant (e.g. in  
the centre of large cities), hydroponic farms may be  
viable irrespective of land values. For example, in Japan  
hydroponic vegetables are grown in supermarkets in the  
centre of large cities. Th e savings on transport costs and  
the benefits of having fresh produce offsets the increased  
cost of space in these cities.  
3. Heavy work is reduced  
Labour for tilling the soil, cultivation, fumigation,  
watering and other traditional practices can be red uced and  
sometimes eliminated.  
4. Water is conserved  
A well -designed, properly run hydroponic system uses less  
water than gardening. This is an important advantage in  
areas with poor quality or limited water supplies. In  
particular, hydroponics is seen  to have potential benefits in  
controlling water pollution in developing countries.  
5. Pest and disease problems are reduced  
The need to fumigate is reduced. Soil -borne plant  
diseases are more easily eradicated in many nutriculture  
systems. This is part icularly true in - closed systems -  which  
can be totally f looded with an eradicant. The chance of  
soil-borne human disease is also reduced. Though rare  
in developed countries, it is possible for diseases to be  
transmitted from animal manures or soil m icroorganisms  
onto food plants grown in soil, leading to illness.  
6. Weed problems are almost eliminated  
Weeds are a major problem in most soil -based systems.  Weeds are almost non -existent in hydroponic setups.  
7. Yields can be maximised  
Maximum yields are possible, making the system  
economically feasible in high density and expensive land  
areas.  
8. Nutrients are conserved  
This can lead to a reduction in pollution of land and  
streams because valuable chemicals  needn - t be lost.  
9. The environment is more easily controlled  
For example, in greenhouse operations the light,  
temperature, humidity and composition of the atmosphere  
can be manipulated,

while in the root zone the timing and frequency of nutrient  
feeding and irrigation can be readily controlled.  
10. Root zone chemistry is easier to control  
Salt toxicities can be leached out; pH can be adjusted; EC  
(electroconductivity) can be adjusted. Also salts will not bind  
chemically to the majority of media used in hydroponics so  
problems of salt build -up that may occur in soils, particularly  
when highly soluble nutrients are used, are uncommon in  hydroponics.  
11. New plants are easier to establish  
Transplant shock is reduced.  
12. Crop rotation/fallowing is not necessary  
All areas can be used at all times -  you don - t need to leave  
a paddock for a year to fallow every so often.  
The amateur horticulturist can use hydroponic systems at home,  
even in high rise buildings. A nutri culture system can be clean,  
lightweight, and mechanised.  
 
Disadvantages  
1. Initial cost is high  
The original construction cost per hectare is great. This may limit  
you to growing crops which either have a fast turnover or  
give a high return.  
2. Skill a nd knowledge are needed to operate properly  
Trained plantsmen must direct the growing operation.  
Knowledge of how plants grow and the principles of nutrition  
are important.  
3. Diseases and pests can spread quickly through a system  
Introduced diseases and  nematodes may be quickly spread to  
all beds using the same nutrient tank in a closed system.  
4. Beneficial soil life is normally absent  
5. Plants react fast to both good and bad conditions  
The plants in hydroponics react more quickly to changes in  
growi ng conditions. This means that the hydroponic gardener  
needs to watch his plants more closely for changes.  
6. Available plant varieties are not always ideal  
Most available plant varieties have been developed for  growth in soil and in the open. Developmen t of varieties which  
are specifically adapted to more controlled conditions may  
be slow to occur.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 2 : SITE CONSIDERATIONS   
 
 
 
What you grow successfully in a hydroponic  
installation is largely dependent on where you  
are located. The local climate, availability and  
quality of water and local demand for what is  
grown are all key considerations.  
 
 
CLIMATE  
Climate affects what can be grown, and at what times of  
the year i t can be grown. Even with the help of greenhouses  
or other environmental controls, the outside environment  
still has a great bearing upon the economic viability of  
using hydroponic systems.  
It is not simply a matter of the quality of the environment,  
quantity is also critical. For example, to grow  
cucumbers it is not enough to just get warm weather, the  
number of days of warm weather is also critical.  
Some of the more important factors to consider are:  
 
Temperature  Temperature affects the development of f lowers or fruit in  
many different types of plants. Very often the plant not only  
needs the temperature to be at a certain level, but it needs  
the right sequence of day temperatures. For example,  
many chrysanthemums need a sequence where day  
temperatures are warm during the early stages of f lower  
development but gradually become cooler as the flower  
buds develop and approach maturity.  
 
Frost -sensitive period  
Frost can kill or severely damage a crop. Bad frosts will to  
some extent even penetrate the walls of a greenhouse,  
burning plants inside. Even plants which are generally  
tolerant of frosts can be badly damaged if the frost  
occurs at t he wrong time of year:  
-  Virtually all fruit or flower buds are susceptible to frost.  
If frosts are likely to occur at a time close to when  
flower buds open, fruit development may be stopped  
even if the rest of the plant is unaffected.  
-  Some young se edlings are killed by frost.  
-  Tender, lush new growth is more susceptible to frost.  
You need to know when frosts are likely to occur on a  
particular site, and select crops for that site which do not  
have a high risk of frost damage.  
 
Day length  
Day len gth, along with temperature, is the most  
important factor in causing f lower buds to form and  
fruit to develop. For some plants, the appropriate  sequence of day length must take place for you to achieve  
a good crop. For other plants a minimum or maximu m day  
length must occur before f lower buds will form. For  
example, African violets require at least 16 hours of  
daylight -  or artificial light -  for f lowering to occur.  
 
 
Brightness  
For some plants, the intensity of light is just as critical as  
the length of light period. Many vegetables and herbs do not  
produce the same quality or quantity of yield if light intensities  
are too low. Other plants must have lower light intensities,  
preferring shaded conditions.  
A slope which catches the midday sun (i.e. north facing in the  
southern hemisphere) will have higher light intensities than one  
facing away from the afternoon sun. A site covered by tall  
trees or beside tall buildings will have lower light intensities than  
one facing away from the afternoon sun. A site in a valley may  
have lower light intensities than one on a ridge or a f lat  
plain.  
 
Rainfall  
In low to medium rainfall areas, there is generally less need for  
hydroponic i nstallations to be covered than in high rainfall areas,  
where the rainfall can dilute nutrient solutions or leach  
nutrients out of the system.  
 
Humidity  
Humid environments are suitable for some crops and unsuited to  others. High humidity generally incre ases the likelihood of fungal  
diseases. Pollen may become more sticky and move around less  
easily in very humid situations. This can lead to a decrease in  
pollination of f lowers which in turn may decrease the number of  
fruit forming.  
 
Evaporation  
Consider how fast water is lost through evaporation. This may  
influence your choice of hydroponic system. Some systems  
minimise loss through evaporation more th an others.  
 
Aspect  
The best site will be relatively f lat but with a slight slope to allow  
water to drain away. The site should not be prone to f  
looding.  
A north -facing slope (in the southern hemisphere) will catch  
winter sun and be less prone to cold southerly winds or  
frosts. Sites in valleys are more prone to frosts, and will not  
become as warm in summer.  
 
Wind  
Wind can damage plants and greenhouses. In wind prone areas, it  
may be advisable to plant a windbreak to provide protection.  
Some wind is needed for proper cross -pollination with  
certain crops. Air movement can also be beneficial by stopping  
disease spores from settling in one place and infecting a  
plant.  
The crops, therefore, that you choose to grow should match the  
climatic patterns of  the site.   
 
WATER REQUIREMENTS  
Water quality and quantity have a very important effect  
upon the viability of any hydroponic installation. You may  
get water from town water supplies, a river or other  
watercourse, rainfall, dams, bores or even distilled sea  
water. In today - s increasingly polluted world, no water  
supply can be guaranteed to remain suitable for any  
great length of time. Watercourse s in Australia are  
increasingly being affected by rising levels of salts. Acid rain  
is contaminating water supplies in Europe and America. You  
may need to face the prospect of treating water to remove  
impurities at some stage in the future if the quali ty of  
your supply is not very clean.  
Water with sodium levels below 500 ppm can be used for  
hydroponics, though much lower levels are preferred.  
The types of salts making up the ppm value will affect the  
salinity level that plants will tolerate. Water can contain a  
large range of minerals  
- some are useful and will be taken up by plants, in  
which case the nutrient formulation for the crop needs  
to be adjusted for the presence of these to prevent  
accumulation and nutrient imbalances.  
Useful minerals often found in many water supplies are  
calcium, magnesium, sulphur and various trace elements.  
The most common problematic salt found in natural water  
supplies is sodium which is often found in high levels in  
wells, dams and even municipal water source s in  countries such as Australia and Africa. Sodium is not  
taken up by plants to any great degree and will  
accumulate in nutrient solutions and growing media,  
creating salt problems. Other common water quality  
problems are the presence of iron or trace elements such as  
boron, copper, manganese and zinc, which are required by  
plants, but such small quantities they can easily accumulate  
to toxic levels when pr esent in the water supply.  
Crops also vary with their tolerance to minerals in the  
water supply. Lettuce crops should not be grown in NFT  
with sodium levels in the water supply much above 40ppm.  
Salt-tolerant crops such as tomatoes in a media system  
can tolerate water supplies with as much as 300ppm  
sodium provided this is monitored in the leachate.  
Some water supplies contain very small quantities of  
other chemicals which will severely affect the crop potential.  
It is important that you know the qua lity of your water  
very well, and that you test it on a regular basis. Water  
quality can vary considerably over time, so even if your  
water tests out as being suitable when you first start, it  
may subsequently change, sometimes very quickly.  
 
Quantity  
Water requirements will vary greatly according to:  
-  Size - larger plants generally need more water.  
-  Wind conditions -  windy sites need more water.  
-  Humidity -  high humidity reduces water requirements.  
-  Rainfall -  if the system is in the open, n atural rainfall  
may add to the water supply (though it may affect  nutrient solution concentration).  
-  Temperature -  hot places lose more water through evaporation.  
-  Type of hydroponic system -  recirculating systems need  
less water than run -to-waste systems. Highly absorbent  
media need less water than poorly absorbent ones. There  
is less water loss when the  
 
 
root zone is surrounded by a water impermeable layer (e.g.  
NFT inside a fully enclosed pipe).  
Most systems will use between 0.25 and 1.25 litres of water  
per day per square metre of growing surface, with the average  
unit normally using 0.5 to 0.6 litres per square metre per  
day.  
 
Quality  
Hard water is that which contains magnesium and calcium  
salts. In the prese nce of soaps, hard water forms a sludge.  
Hard water can be used for hydroponics provided it does not  
contain too much calcium carbonate.  
Copper, zinc, and several heavy metals such as lead or  
mercury can be found as contaminants in some waters. These  
can damage or kill plants. Excessive levels of these metals can  
be removed by slow filtration through a bed of calcareous  
material, e.g. limestone chips or dolomite.  
Free chlorine in large quantities (as found in some town water  
supplies) will damage or even kill plants. High levels can be  
removed by filtering through organic material such as straw.  
Distilled salt water is suitable for hydroponics if obtained  from solar distillation units (NB: Sea water is distilled in metal  
stills in some parts of the  world. In this situation, metals can  
contaminate the water at levels which are harmful to plants,  
though safe for human consumption).  
Very alkaline water can be treated by adding sulphuric acid to  
correct pH. This is done before adding nutrients to make up the  
nutrient solution.  
 
 
PROXIMITY TO MARKETS  
A large part of the cost of operating a hydroponic farm is  
the cost of transporting produce to market.  
You should consider the following:  
-  How close are you to the place where you will sell your produce -  
-  If using road transport, what is the quality of the roads -  
-  Does the route ever suffer traffic jams -  
-  Does the route ever fl ood-  
-  If using rail, how frequent is the rail service -  
-  Is the rail system viable for its operators and if not, is there  
a chance that services might be reduced -  
-  If using air or sea transport, how reliable and regular  
are the services -  
-  Does  the produce need refrigeration or any other special  
treatment during transport and are those services  
available -  
-  If relying on contract services, are they dependable -  Do  
they ever strike or break down -  
-  Will produce deteriorate during transport -  
-  Do you need to produce a truck or other transportation  equipment (e.g. forklift etc) -  
-  What will transportation cost -  
Transportation to market may vary considerably  
depending on the site.

 CHAPTER 3 : ALTERNATIVES   
There are a bewildering number of choices to be made when deciding what type of system to use.  
This chapter is designed to help you choose the system that is right for you.  
Water, Aggregate or Rockwool Culture  
The first choice is whether to use water culture, aggregate culture or rockwool. All three are viable and 
used successfully with  
a large var iety of crops in many different parts of the world.  
Your choice should take into consideration the following:  
-  What is the cost of each and how readily available are materials in your area -  
-  Is rockwool made/sold locally -  If not, what freight charges  are involved in having it delivered -  
-  Is there a local source of sand or gravel which can be used, or do you need to pay high cartage 
costs -  
-  What types of plants will you grow -  
-  Some plants require better aeration than others. Some systems provi de better aeration than 
others, for example NFT systems.

Hydroponic Media  
There are three main groups of hydroponic media, based on their  
origins:  
1. Media derived from rock or stone  
2. Media derived from synthetics  
3. Organic media  
 
General Characteristics  
Media is the term given to the solid material(s) used to replace  
soil in aggregate culture and rockwool culture.  
Hydroponic media must fulfil the following criteria:  
-  They must be chemically inert.  
-  They must be chemically stable.  
-  They must be clean.  
-  They must drain sufficiently freely not to create  
waterlogging p roblems.  
-  They must have adequate water -holding capacity.  
-  They must have adequate air -holding  
capacity. Also:  
-  Buffering capacity should be good -  this is the ability of the  
media to resist changes in pH.  
-  It is preferable that cation exchange capacity is at least  moderate to good.  
Cation Exchange Capacity  
Cations are atoms which have lost electrons. As such they are  
particles which have a positive charge. Many important plant  
nutrients occur in the nutrient solution as cations (i.e. potassiu m,  
calcium and magnesium). These particles will attach  
themselves to media particles which have a negative charge,  
hence staying in the media and being available to the plant roots  
for a longer period of time.  
Organic matter such as peat moss, and fine particles such as  
clay have a lot more negative charges on their surface, hence a  
greater ability to hold cations (higher cation exchange  
capacity) than larger sand or gravel particles. Media with a  
very low c ation exchange capacity will require more frequent  
application of nutrients than ones with a higher cation  
exchange capacity. When nutrient solution is applied to a  
medium with a low cation exchange capacity but high water - 
holding capacity, the medium might remain moist, but the  
nutrients do not remain in it after the irrigation as well as in a  
medium with a high cation exchange capacity.  
 
 
MEDIA DERIVED FROM ROCK  
OR STONE  
Vermiculite  
This is a mineral derived from mica mined in South Africa  
and the  USA. The mined mineral is treated in a number of  
ways including heating at temperatures of nearly 2000  
degrees F to obtain the product used in hydroponics.  Technically vermiculate is hydrated magnesium aluminium  
iron silicate.  
Vermiculite is very ligh t and spongy in appearance,  
though different grades of vermiculite have different  
weights. This mineral retains air, water and nutrients  
very well, making it ideal for hydroponics. The pH of  
vermiculite is sometimes slightly acidic or slightly  
alkaline, although rarely enough to pose much of a  
problem with growth. Its pH buffering capacity is very  
good (i.e. it resists changes in pH) and it has a relatively high  
cation exchange capacity.  
Vermiculite needs to be mixed with other media to get the  
best results. Even though it retains air well, it can retain  
too much water for many plants. If used on its own it  
can after a year or so turn puggy (i.e. the structure can  
collapse). However, mi xed with gravel or sand (no more  
than 40 to 50% vermiculite) it retains its structure, and  
drainage is improved to make it a more ideal medium.  
Vermiculite is also used in the building industry for  
insulation. You should only use horticultural vermiculi te  
in hydroponics. This is available in different grades:  
No.1 -  5 to 8mm in diameter  
No.2 -  3 to 4mm in diameter (this is the standard  
grade) No.3 -  1 to 2mm in diameter  
No.4 -  0.75 to 1mm in diameter (used only in seed germination)  
 
Perlite  
Perlite  is, like vermiculite, a processed mineral. It has  
excellent water -holding properties but is less spongy  and better drained than vermiculite. Perlite is made from a  
silicaceous volcanic rock treated at temperatures of 1400  
degrees F to form sponge -like balls. Perlite is often used by  
itself or in a 50/50 mixture with vermiculite (this type of mix  
can become too wet in some situations though). Perlite can  
be neutral or slightly acid. It has poor pH buffering capacity  
and no cation exchange capacity.  
As it is predominantly white, algal growth may easily occur  
on perlite, and while this does not harm the plants it  
can clog up pipes etc in a recirculating s ystem. Perlite is  
excellent for plant propagation purposes. It can be  
expensive. Like vermiculite it is relatively lightweight.  
 
 
Sand  
Granitic or silica -type sands should be used. Calcareous  
sands are very alkaline and unsuited to plant growth. Beach s and  
is not suitable because of the high levels of salt in it. Some  
sands have a lot of dust or other fine material in them when  
purchased and these need to be washed out before it is used.  
The best sand is the coarse granitic sand used by nurserymen for   
plant propagation and in fish aquariums. By itself sand will need  
frequent, if not constant f low of irrigation to prevent the plants  
drying out. It is often mixed with other water -retaining materials  
though to obtain a balanced medium.  
 
Gravel  
Gravel  is much the same as sand, only varying in particle  
size. Gravel particles are generally 2 to 15 mm in diameter,  whereas sand particles are smaller, but still gritty to feel.  
Sand will hold water better than gravel.  
 
Scoria  
Scoria is porous volcanic roc k which can be obtained in a wide  
variety of grades (i.e. sizes or diameters). The physical  
properties of scoria are excellent, but its pH can vary greatly  
according to where it comes from (pH 7 to 10). The cost of scoria  
is usually dependent on the distance it has to be transported. If  
you are close to a scoria quarry it can be cheap; if you are some  
distance away it can be expensive.  
 
Pumice  
This is a si licaceous volcanic rock, which is crushed and screened  
before use. Its properties are very similar to perlite except that it  
is heavier and does not absorb water as easily. Pumice is  
sometimes mixed with peat and sand to make a hydroponic  
medium.  
 
Rock wool  
Rockwool is made from heating rock to a molten state and  
spinning it into fine fibres to create a spongy, fibrous  
material which is used both for insulation (in the building  
industry) and in horticulture. Horticultural rockwool is  
processed differ ently from insulation rockwool. You should not  
use the insulation material in horticulture.  
Horticultural rockwool is available in a loose fibre form (not  
unlike cotton wool or fleece), or in preformed slabs of  
varying shapes and depths. Rockwool slabs are more than  90% air space and so have the ability to hold large amounts of  
water while still retaining an extremely good level of aeration.  
This characteristic makes rockwool one of the most popular and  
commonly used media in commercial hydroponics i n Australia,  
the Netherlands and several other countries.  
Rockwool has no cation exchange capacity and very little effect  
on pH (i.e. the pH of nutrient solution determines the pH of the  
root zone; the rockwool has virtually no effect).  
 
 
Expanded Clay  
Also called LECA (light expanded clay aggregate), this  
material is made by blending and bloating clay in rotary  
kilns. The material looks a little like hard terracotta balls. It  
has a low  air-filled porosity and a higher water holding  
capacity.  
 
 
MEDIA DERIVED FROM SYNTHETIC  
MATERIALS  
Sponge Foams  
Sponge -like materials are used increasingly for propagation  
(cuttings) in some parts of the world (e.g. Florida). The same  
materials have be en used successfully in hydroponic culture.  
Foams are used commercially in hydroponics in the  
Netherlands and Canada. They are generally expensive.  
 
Expanded Plastics  
These materials are inert and in many cases relatively  inexpensive. Their major disadv antages are:  
-  They do not retain moisture or nutrients very well.  
-  They are very lightweight and when mixed with other  
materials, often separate out (or float) to the top (after a couple  
of months use, what was originally a mix will end up as a layer   
of the expanded plastic on top of the rest of the media).  
-  They provide virtually no support for the plant (trellis is vital).  
When used by themselves in a constant f low irrigation  
(automatic watering) situation, these materials can sometimes be  
quite successful.  
Examples include polystyrene (beanbag) balls, hygropor (a  
mix of ureaformaldehyde and polystyrol). Ureaformaldehyde  
releases nitrogen slowly into solution through slow  
decomposition. If it is used for long periods, plants can be  
harmed by formaldehyde residues.  
 
ORGANIC MEDIA  
Sawdust  
Sawdust has been used extensively in commercial hydroponics in  
British Columbia and Canada, mainly because of its  
availability.  
Hardwood sawdusts (e.g. from eucalypts) should be composted  
before use. Some softwood sawdusts should never be used  
because they contain highly toxic chemicals. Pinus radiata  
sawdust has been successful for short -term growing without  
composting (e.g. for propag ation but not for growing a six -month  
crop).  
Sawdust will undergo decomposition while the crop is  
growing if not composted first, and throughout that process the  bacteria will draw on nitrogen from the nutrient solution leaving  
insufficient quantities for the plants.  
Coarse sawdusts have been used successfully in potting soils in  
Australia, and should work in hydroponics. Fine sawdusts are  
preferred by the hydroponic growers in Canada, though fine  
sawdusts have caused problems when used in potting mixes in  
Australia. Cation exchange capacity is good, but not as high  
as in peat.  
 
 
Peat moss  
Peat moss is dug from swampy ground in cool temperate  
climates. It is the partially decomposed remains of pl ants  
(mainly mosses and sedges). The specific characteristics of  
peat can vary from one deposit to another though the  
following generalisations can be made:  
-  Peat has a high water -holding capacity.  
-  Sphagnum peats generally have better aeration when   
wet than sedge peats.  
-  They are not totally free of nutrients. Some peats have a  
lot more mineral salts in them than others  
-  Black peat, which is more highly decomposed, is not  
suitable for hydroponics at all.  
-  Peat is always acidic (sometimes as  low as 4.0).  
-  All peats have a high pH buffering capacity.  
-  They have a high cation exchange capacity.  
-  Peat repels water when it dries out. Be careful never to  
allow the surface of the medium to become completely  
dry. Peat is useful as an additiv e to hydroponic media to  
raise the cation exchange capacity, particularly in run -to- 
waste systems, though it will bring micronutrients to the  
system which could upset the balance of the nutrient  
solution.  
Only coarse grade, high quality peat should be used in  
hydroponic culture.  
 
Coir fibre (coconut fibre)  
Coir fibre has been rapidly accepted as a high quality  
hydroponic growing medium and is available in a range of  
propagation cubes, blocks, slabs simil ar to rockwool, and as  
a loose, granular product. Coir fines should be mixed with  
longer fibres when used as a growing medium while fines  
alone are suitable for seed raising.  
Coir has a high water -holding capacity and air -filled porosity  
and holds its structure well over time. As a growing medium  
it can be used for several years and sterilised between  
crops.  
Care should be taken with some supplies of coir which may  
be contaminated with high levels of sodium. Hydroponic  
growers should always select - sodium free -  horticultural  
grade coir to avoid this problem.  
 
Composted bark  
The use of composed bark has become popular as a peat  
substitute and it provides both an excellent seed  
germination medium and hydroponic substrate. Bark for  
horticultural u se is pre -composted with additional nitrogen  to create a stabilised product suitable for hydroponic use.  
Bark is superior to peat in many cases provided the  
correct grade is selected. Hydroponic bark media  
should be composed of ground fines and coarser  particles  
which resist packing down when in use and retain high  
levels of aeration.  
 
 
STERILISATION  
Sterilisation with either chemicals or steam may be carried  
out to kill all pests and diseases in a hydroponic system or  
greenhouse prior to planting. This would commonly be done in  
the following situations:  
-  If a new system is installed in a locality where there may be  
diseases or pests.  
-  In a newly constru cted greenhouse before planting the first crop.  
-  Where crops have been grown in the same medium for a  
long period, and diseases or pests have built up in the system.  
Steam Sterilisation  
This is expensive if you have to buy a steam generator; however,  
many greenhouse installations are heated with steam. It is  
relatively easy to install a steam converter onto an existing  
boiler and run steam pipes to a greenhouse with outlet pipes at  
required intervals.  
Aggregate beds are easily treated by simply runni ng a pipe with  
outlets along its length down the centre of a bed and covering the  
bed with a heat resistant cover. Application of steam at 180  
degrees F for half an hour will sterilise about 20cm depth of  
sawdust or peat, or 10cm of 75% sand 25% peat. A permanent  pipe laid below the surface at the bottom of the bed will give  
a better penetration of steam.  
A steam sterilised bed can be used the day after treatment.  
 
Chemical Sterilisation  
a) With gas  
This involves pumping chemical gasses such as methyl bromide  
or chloropicrin into a sealed area. The area is generally covered  
with large plastic sheets and the gas released via a pipe or  
tube under the sheet. Alternatively an entire greenhouse can  
be sterilised if it is totally sealed from the outside.  
After a predetermined period (usually a matter of days), the  
covers are lifted or the building is opened. The area must be  
aired for a period to allow chemical residues to disappear  
before use.  
b) With liquid  
Formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite and some other liquid  
preparations can be used to wash through hydroponic systems  
and over surrounding areas to kill pests and diseases. These  
are easy to use and relatively inexpensive, although you must  
be sure to wash away any residual chemicals before introducing  
plants into such areas.  
 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER 4 : PLANT NUTRITION   
NUTRIENT FORMULAS  A nutrient solution must contain nitrogen, phosphorus,  
potassium, magnesium, calcium and sulphur if plants are to make   
reasonable growth. These nutrients are all needed in  
significant quantities by all plants. Oxygen, hydrogen and  
carbon are also essential; however, these are obtained by the  
plant from air and water.  
A large number of other nutrients are also needed, but in  
very small amounts. These minor nutrients may find their way  
into a nutrient solution through impurities in the water or  
dust particles in the air, and that may be good enough for success  
in an amateur hydroponic grower - s garden. The commercial  
grower, however, is well advised to use a nutrient solution  
with minute amounts of these minor nutrients added.  
Minor nutrients such as iron, copper, boron, manganese, zinc,  
cobalt and molybdenum are j ust as important as the major  
nutrients; they are just used in much smaller quantities.  
 
PREPARING NUTRIENT SOLUTIONS  
Nutrient solutions for small hydroponic systems can often be  
adequately prepared by adding some additional components to a  
standard, ge neral fertiliser (e.g. 5 parts gypsum and 1 part Epsom  
salts added to 6 parts of any powdered soluble plant food such as  
Thrive, Aquasol or Phostrogen). Sometimes it might be  
necessary to add a minute amount of micronutrient. Commercial  
hydroponic grow ers need a more accurate control of the  
components in a nutrient solution to achieve commercial  
success.  
A large number of different nutrient formulas have been  
developed for use in hydroponics. Some give better results  than others, however there is no  single formula that  
outshines all the others. The success of each formula depends  
on the conditions in which it is used and on which plants are  
being grown.  
To make a nutrient solution you need to know the relative  
amounts of the different nutrients a plant requires. The  
requirement is different for different types of plants. You need to  
know what proportion of each chemical ingredient you are  
using is actually the nutrient (e.g. one chemical might contain  
20% ni trogen and another chemical 45% nitrogen; you need  
less than half as much of the second chemical to supply the  
same amount of nitrogen).  
You also need to know how soluble the chemicals you use are.  
 
 
Some chemicals need more water or more mixing than oth ers. 
Be aware of potential interactions between the chemicals you  
use. Some chemicals cannot be mixed with others -  they react  
together and become something new: something you might not  
want in the solution, or something inert that can - t be used by  
the plants you are growing.  
 
 
Ionisation of Nutrients in Solution  
In hydroponics, ionisation is the process whereby fertiliser  
salts break into their individual ions when dissolved in  
water. This allows rapid uptake of nutrient by plant roots.  
 
Calculatin g the Amount of  Nutrient in a Chemical  
The proportion by weight of a nutrient element in a  
nutrient salt can be calculated as follows:  
 
 
1. Write down the chemical formula of the salt. This should be  
on the product label. For example: Ammonium  
sulphate  
(NH4)2SO4  
This simply means NH4 plus NH4 plus SO4  
In total then ammonium sulphate  
contains: 2 nitrogen atoms  
8 hydrogen atoms  
1 sulphur atom  
4 oxygen  
atoms  
2. Look up the atomic weights of each of the elements in the  
nutrient salt and multiply them by the number of  
atoms of each element present in the chemical formula  
for that molecule.  
For example:  
Nitrogen (atomic weight = 14) 2 ato ms x 14 = 28  
Hydrogen (atomic weight = 1) 8 atoms x 1 = 8  
Sulphur (atomic weight = 32) 1 atom x 32 = 32  
Oxygen (atomic weight = 16) 4 atoms x 16 = 64  
3. Add up the total weights as calculated.  
For example:  
28 + 8 + 32 + 64 = 132  
The molecular weight of amm onium sulphate is therefore 132  4. Take the total calculated weight of the nutrient element (i.e. in  
the above example this is 28 for nitrogen in ammonium  
sulphate) and divide this by the molecular weight of the  
nutrient salt (in this example that would  be 132) giving  
28/132 x 100/1 = 21.3%. This means that 21.3% of any  
quantity of ammonium sulphate is actually nitrogen.  
 
 
Another example of Calculating the Amount of  
Nutrient in a Chemical  
The formula for sulphate of potash (Potassium  
Sulphate) is K2SO4:  
2 atoms of potassium -  2 x 39 =78  
1 atom of sulphur -  1 x 32 = 32  
4 atoms of oxygen -  4 x 16 =  
64 Total = 174  
Percentage of potassium = 78/174 x 100/1 = 44%  
Note that many of the nutrient chemicals listed in  
the table in the next page contain sulphur. Sulphates are  
commonly used because plants tolerate large amounts of  
sulphur. An excess of unused sulphates around the plants -   
roots will be less damaging than an excess of chloride or  
something else.  
Chemicals should be stored according to the in a dry  
place until you are ready to use them. Choose your  
fertilisers not only on the basis of the nutrients they supply  
but also on how easy they are to obtain and how much they  
cost in term s of the amount of nutrient the fertilisers supply.  
The most common way of describing the content of a  nutrient solution is in parts per million (ppm). Since a gram  
of weight is equivalent to 1 cubic centimetre of water then  
1 ppm is equivalent to 1 gra m of water in 1 million cubic  
centimetres of water (1000 litres). 1000 litres is equivalent  
to about 264 US gallons. If you are using US measurements  
you can convert to ounces by dividing grams by 28.35 and  
litres to gallons by multiplying litres by 0.2642.

To make a solution containing, for example, 1 ppm of a particular  
nutrient you would need to add 1 gram of that nutrient to  
1000 litres of water. To work out how much of the particular  
chemical you are using to supply that nu trient you would  
need to add to the 1000 litres of water, you need to know what  
percentage of the chemical is the actual nutrient. Based on the  
previous example this can be calculated as follows:  
If the amount of nitrogen in ammonium sulphate is 23.1%, then  
simply adding 1 gram of ammonium sulphate to the 1000 litres of  
water would only add 0.231 grams (23.1% of 1 gram) to the  
water. To get 1 gram of nitrogen you would need to work out  
the ratio between the amount of ammonium sulphate and the  amount  of nitrogen present in the ammonium sulphate. This  
can be done by dividing the molecular weight of ammonium  
sulphate by the weight of nitrogen found in the ammonium  
sulphate as follows:  
132/28 = 4.7  
 
 
This means that to obtain 1 gram of nitrogen you would  
need to add 4.7 grams of ammonium sulphate to the 1000  
litres. This conversion factor of 4.7 remains constant for the  
supply of nitrogen using ammonium sulphate as a source, so  
that if you wanted f or example a solution containing 200  
ppm of nitrogen you would simply multiply 200 x 4.7 to  
give 940 grams of ammonium sulphate being required to go  
in 1000 litres of water. This technique can be used just as  
simply for the other chemicals used in hydr oponics stock  
solutions.  
 
 
Preparing a Solution  
A simple means of preparing a nutrient solution is as follows:  
-  First weigh nutrient chemicals individually  
-  Lay the chemicals out in separate piles and check each noting  
the colour of the chemical and relative sizes of the amounts, to  
ensure the proportions make sense and no mistakes have  
been made.  
-  Be particularly careful that no chemical component is left out  
or measured twice.  
-  Accuracy of weighing should be within plus or minus 5%  (within t his range the effect on plants will be negligible).  
-  After all this has been done, add the chemicals to the mixing  
tanks and stir vigorously until dissolved (the order in which  
the chemicals are added is unimportant, but it is extremely  
important to d issolve less soluble salts such as  
superphosphate as much as possible. There will always be  
some material which doesn - t dissolve but this is generally not  
enough to be significant.  
-  After mixing the nutrients the pH may need adjusting (see the  
section on pH).  
-  Micronutrients should always be added after pH is adjusted in  
the solution.  
Example solutions  
The following solutions give an indication of the types  
of combinations of chemicals that are commonly used.  
Example 1  
All quantities are based on using pure water. Two  
concentrated stock solutions are made up as shown below:  
 
 
Dilution  
Each stock solution should be diluted to 1 in 100. Do  
not mix the concentrated stock solutio ns. When you are  
ready to apply the nutrient solutions, mix the diluted  
stock solutions then. This is because fertilisers  
containing calcium will react with any containing  
phosphate in a stock solution to form calcium phosphate.  
This will precipitate out of the solution and fall to the bottom  
of the tank or container holding the solution, where it  forms a sludge. The majority of the calcium and phosphate in  
the stock solution becomes unavailable to your plants and  
the insoluble calcium phosphate sl udge may block  
irrigation lines and nozzles. It is also important not to mix  
calcium nitrate in a stock solution with magnesium sulphate  
because calcium sulphate will precipitate out of the  
solution. The majority of other chemicals commonly used in  
stock solutions can be mixed together, however care should  
be taken when using previously untried formulations that  
precipitation doesn - t occur.  
Example 2  
: Basic vegetative tomato formulation for use from  
seedling until fruit set with high quality (RO) water sources.  
This recipe gives the amount of fertiliser salts to  
dissolve into  two  100  litre  stock  solution   
(concentrate)  tanks. A one in 100 dilution rate will  
give an EC of 3.0 mS/  cm and TDS of 2100. (TDS  
is the total dissolved solids).

When diluted to an EC of 3.0, will give the following

Note: This formulation should be adjusted as the crop goes  
through differing levels of fruit loading to include higher ratios of  
potassium. Formulation is designed for a high quality, pure water  
source such as RO water and should be adjusted for the  
presence of any elements present in other water supplies.  
Recommended pH level for this formulation is 5.8 and EC of 3.0,  
season and cropping system dependent. Potassium nitrate in  
this formula is split between the A and B stock solution tanks to  
prevent problems with solubility.

nutrient solution. An iron stock solution is also requir ed.  
This should contain 1 gram of actual iron per litre of  
stock solution. One litre of iron stock is sufficient for 1000  
litres of dilute nutrient solution.  
The above stock solutions are just a few of the many  
solutions that have been developed for general use. Each  
plant, however, has different nutritional requirements,  
and these may vary at different stages of the plant - s  
growth. For example when the pl ant is making a lot of leaf  
growth the nitrogen requirements are generally higher  
than when the plant is fruiting. Stock solutions can  
generally be modified to some degree to be suitable for the  
majority of cultivated plants; however some may require  
specific formulations.  
 
Estimates of Nutrient Quantities  
When you are not sure about the type and quantity of  
nutrients to be used then some relatively simple  
techniques can give you a clue:  
1. The most suitable ranges of nutrient concentrations  
for a n utrient solution appear in the table below.  
2. Experimentation -  simply try growing a few plants of  
the crop you are interested in. If these show  
recognisable signs of nutrient deficiency or toxicity then  
you can adjust your nutrient solution according ly. It  
is important to be careful of your solution pH as this  
will affect nutrient take up in the plant (see section on  
pH).  3. Growers who are capable of testing the nutrient status of  
their run -off solution can determine which nutrients  
are being ta ken up by the plants in what quantities, and  
adjust their nutrient solutions accordingly.  
4. A rough indication of nutrient requirements can often be  
obtained by consideration of the type of crop you are  
growing. For example crops with a high percentage of  
leafy material are likely to have medium to high  
nitrogen requirements, while root crops often require  
moderate to high levels of phosphorus. Com parisons can  
often be drawn with similar growing crops.  
5. Many agricultural and horticultural journals and texts  
provide nutrient advice and research results on  
particular crop species. It is often possible to get a  
good indication of the nutrient req uirements of  
particular plants from these. A good example is the  
text Plant Analysis edited by D. J. Reuter and J. B.  
Robinson (Inkata Press Melbourne), which gives a  
strong indication of the nutrient requirements for a wide  
range of crop plants, base d on analysis of the  
relationship between yields and nutrient  
concentrations in plant tissues.  
 
 
There are now nutrient software programmes (such as the  
Nutron 2000+ hydroponic nutrient formulation software)  
which will not only provide accurate startin g formulae for most  
commonly grown crops but also allow a grower to create a new  
formula and adjust this for season, stage of growth, water  supply etc. This is how many inexperienced growers are  
managing and formulating nutrients without having to do t he  
calculations themselves. Guessing or estimating at nutrient  
formulas ends up with many crop failures and often many of  
the - published formulas -  are not suitable for every cropping  
situation.

Propagation  
If nutrition is needed during propagation, a weaker solution  
should be used, i.e. the above solutions should be diluted by  
a further 1 in 4.  
 
What is pH -  
pH is a measurement of the hydrogen ion concentration in a  
particular medium, such as water, soil, gravel etc. More  
simply it refers to the acidity or alkalinity of that medium. The  
ph is measured on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0 to 14 with 7  
being considered neutral, above 7 being considered alkaline  
and be low 7 as acid.  
The pH of a medium or a nutrient solution is important to plant  
growth. Each particular plant has a preferred pH range in  
which hit grows. If a plant is subjected to a pH outside of its  
preferred range at the least its growth will be reta rded, or it  
may even die. Very low pH (less than pH = 4.5) and very high pH  
conditions (above pH = 9) can directly damage plant roots.  
Most commercially grown hydroponic species prefer a  
slightly acidic solution in the pH range 5.8 to 6.5. However, plan ts  
can survive in the pH range 5 to 7.5. As the pH rises from  6.5 to 7.5  
 
 
or 8, some elements such as iron, manganese and  
phosphorus become less available and deficiency  
symptoms may begin to show, even though these nutrients  
are present in sufficient levels in the solution. Too high a pH  
will precipitate out iron in hydroponic solutions making it  
unavailable for plant uptake and causing chlorosis of the  
upper leaves. Some forms of iron chelate can withstand  
higher pH levels than others and this should be taken  
into consideration when formulating nutrient solutions  
using water supplies with naturally high pH and  
alkalinity. Growers should be aware that the availabil ity of  
nutrients at different pH levels differs for soilless mediums  
than for mineral or organic soils and diagrams shown in  
reference books for soils are not accurate for hydroponic  
crops. Optimum pH levels differ for various crops with  
tomatoes for example preferring an optimum pH of 5.8 - 6.0,  
while lettuce prefers 6.0 - 6.2. 
Very high and low pH values can also affect plants as follows:  
1. As the pH of a medium changes so does the availability of  
nutrients. The majority of nutrients are most  
available at a pH range of 6 to 7.5. Somewhere in this  
range is generally considered to be the ideal for growing  
the majority of plants although there are plants that  
prefer higher or lower pH conditions. In some  
circumstances, particularly at very high o r very low pH  
conditions, some nutrients may become - locked -  in the  medium, becoming unavailable for plant growth. The  
nutrients may be there in the medium but the plant can - t  
use them. At very low pH conditions, toxic levels of some  
nutrients such  as manganese and aluminium may be  
released.  
2. As the pH of some media is raised more negative charges  
are produced on some colloid surfaces making them  
capable of holding more cations. This allows some media  
to hold larger quantities of nutrients. The majority of  
hydroponic media are not affected in this way as  
they are basically inert materials such as sand and  
gravel, however media that contains cla ys or some of  
those derived from volcanic materials can be affected.  
3. Like plants, microorganisms have a preferred pH range  
in which they thrive. Altering the pH may severely affect  
the populations of both beneficial and detrimental  
microorganisms. F or example the bacteria that  
convert ammonium to nitrogen prefer a pH above 6.  
Most mycorrhizal fungi prefer a pH range between 4 and  
8. 
 
 
NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY AT DIFFERENT PH LEVELS

47, pp. 566 -576)  
 
  
Adjusting the pH  
Before using a solution you should test its pH. Ready to use  
nutrient solution should normally have a pH between 6 and 6.5  
(though for some types of plants the ideal pH is higher  or  
lower than this). If necessary the pH can be changed as  
follows:  
-  Adding lime (or some other calcareous component) will raise  
the pH.  
-  Adding diluted sulphuric or nitric acid will lower pH.  
-  Ammonium salts will acidify (e.g. ammonium sulphate).  
-  As some nutrients are absorbed and others are left in the root  
environment, the pH will change.  
-  Careful addition of caustic soda will increase pH.  
Some types of aggregate media will affect the pH of the nutrient  
solution and root zone, for example peat is acidic and  
freshly mined scoria is alkaline. If the medium is to be wet  
initially with nutrient solution then the pH of the solutio n used,  
for the initial wetting only, should be lowered or raised when the  
medium has a high or low pH.  
Conductivity  
Conductivity is a measure of the rate at which a small  
electric current f lows through a solution. When there is a greater  
concentratio n of nutrients, the current will f low faster, and when  
there is a lower concentration, the current f lows more slowly. By  
measuring conductivity, you can determine just how strong  
or weak a nutrient solution is. A conductivity meter is used to  
make su ch measurements. Conductivity can be measured in any  
of the following units:   
 
 
-  EC is short for - electroconductivity - . EC is expressed as  
either millimhos per centimetre (i.e. mMho/cm), or as  
millisiemen per centimetre (i.e. mS/cm). Note:  
1mMho/cm = 1 mS/cm.  
-  CF is short for - conductivity factor - . CF is expressed on a  
scale of 1 to 100, where 0 stands for pure water  
containing no nutrient and 100 represents maximum  
strength of nutrient salts in solution.  
Parts per million (ppm) is a measure of, the ratio of one part  
to one million of another. The ppm of a solution is measured  
using a ppm meter. This device initially takes an electrical  
conductivity (EC, measured in mS/cm, milliSiemens per  
centimeter) reading. The ppm meter uses a conversion factor  
(usually 1 mS/cm EC=700 ppm at 20°C or 68°F) to determine  
the ppm reading. EC and CF are better readings to use, as  
different nutrient solutions are made up of different ratios  
and forms of nutrient salts, each of which conducts  
electricity at a different rate. This means that similar  
solutions could yield different ppm readings. In addition,  
different solutions that are made up of different proportions  
of mineral salts can yield similar ppm readings.  
EC is generally measured at 25  degrees C, and most  
literature and recommendations are based upon the  
nutrient solution being at that temperature. If the  
temperature of a solution is raised, the EC will increase,  
even though there are no extra nutrients added. If the  temperature dr ops, the EC will decrease. It is possible to  
calculate the change in EC when temperature changes by  
multiplying the EC by a conversion factor (refer to table  
below).

Conductivity and Hydroponics  
-  Conductivity needs to be regularly monitored in a hydroponic  
system.  
-  Different plants have preferred conductivity levels at which  they will grow their best. These levels can vary during a  
crop - s life.  
-  A grower should determine the desired conductivity for the  
crop being grown, and any changes in that desired  level from  
one stage of a crop to the next.  
-  As a solution uses nutrients, the EC will drop. When a drop is  
detected, nutrients should be added to the solution to bring it  
back to the desired level.  
 
 
Water in Hydroponic Solutions  
Hydroponic producers use a variety of water sources to mix  
their nutrient solutions, with rainwater being the most  
highly sought after. Many producers, however must  
use bore water which is harder and lower quality. In  
hydr oponic production where nutrients are constantly  
recirculated, the composition of water can be a serious  
problem.  
Water conditioning units are now available. Research on  
one of these conditioners, - Calclear -  was carried out by  
SUNTEC, an independent hydroponic research  
organisation in New Zealand. The research determined  
that the Calclear units break up crystalline structures  
(such as calcium carbonate in hard water) into ions. In  
essence, they ionise the crystals that form lime scale on  
pipes an d equipment. They can potentially do this in  
nutrient solutions, should any crystals have formed.  
The units seemed to work by increasing the uptake and  
distribution of water and calcium through the xylem vessels  of the plants growing in the treated nut rient solution. In  
some way the units effected either the root cells or the  
development of the xylem vessels, keeping the xylem vessels  
unblocked. In this particular trial, the use of the Calclear  
conditioners reduced the occurrence of tipburn in lettu ce. 
Detecting Deficiencies and Toxicities  
An important means of managing the nutrient  
requirements of your plants is the ability to recognise  
signs of nutrient deficiencies or toxicities, ideally as early  
as possible so that such problems can be rectified with  
minimal impact on crop yields. Such recognition can be  
aided by the use of simple keys such as the following  
one.

Salinity Build -up 
When a plant uses a nutrient from a chemical - salt-  molecule  
supplied in a nutrient solution, it is in fact using only one part  
of that molecule . The remaining part of the molecule generally  
stays in the hydroponic system. It may be used by the plant, but  
more commonly it builds up in the system, and eventually  
can reach a level of concentration where it causes damage to  
the plant.  
This is ref erred to as - salt build -up-  or a - salinity -  problem.  
Salinity problems are most common when media with a high  
cation exchange capacity are used, or in a closed system using  
the same nutrient solution for an extended period.  
Salinity problems will so metimes be visible. If you see a  
white caking around pipes, water outlets, or on the surface of the  media, this indicates the problem is reaching the danger  
level.  
Salinity can be cured or prevented simply by leaching the  
salt build -up out of the syste m by washing it through with  
water. This water must of course be drained out of the system to  
remove unwanted salts.  
 
 
Soil Life and Hydroponics  
In soil there are many different types of relationships  
which develop between plant roots and microorganisms  
such as bacteria and fungi. Some such relationships can be  
of great benefit to the plant, helping it to secure nutrients  
from the soil. When a plant is grown in hydroponics, free  
of all harmful microorganisms, it is free of the beneficial  
organisms also.  
Some plants must have certain microorganisms, such as  
mycorrhizal fungi, living around their roots in order for  
them to grow properly. Orchi ds and mushrooms are two  
examples. Such plants will not perform in hydroponics if the  
root environment is very clean!  
A number of microorganisms have the ability to convert  
atmospheric nitrogen into forms such as ammonium or  
nitrate which can then be u tilised by plants. These  
microorganisms include Rhizobium bacteria, some  
actinomycetes and some blue - green algae. Rhizobium  
bacteria have a symbiotic relationship with leguminous - 
type plants in which they provide a source of nitrogen to  
the plant and  receive in return other nutrients such as  carbohydrates. The nitrogen is - fixed -  by the Rhizobium  
bacteria in nodules on the roots of the legumes and is  
thus directly available to the plants. Inoculation of media  
deficient in Rhizobium bacteria can be achieved by grinding  
the root nodules from mature legumes and mixing them in a  
small amount of water and then adding the mix to the  
nutrient solution.  
It has been suggested by Cooper (The ABC of NFT, 1979,  
Grower Books, London) that only very low concentrations of  
nitrogen are required in the nutrient solution if the  
supply is maintained, and that it may be possible to provide  
an optimal balance of n itrogen - fixing plants to non -fixing  
plants in a cropping system, whereby nitrogen exuded from  
the roots of the nitrogen -fixing plants would be carried  
by the recirculating solution to the other plants.  
Recent research into the micro organisms which rap idly  
colonise hydroponic systems has shown that in most cases  
(i.e. where continual sterilisation of the nutrient solution  
is not carried out) the microbes which develop are  
similar species to those found in the soil beneath the  
hydroponics system and  in the surrounding area.  
Nutrient solutions are not free of microorganisms, but in  
most healthy systems, the beneficial species of microbes will  
out- compete and dominate any pathogenic species. If  
oxygen levels in the recirculating nutrients such as those in  
NFT drop to low levels, then pathogenic microbes often  
dominate and induce diseases such as Pythium and other  
root rots. Research into microbe populations in hydroponics  
has suggested maintaining healthy populations of `good -   microbes is hig hly beneficial to plant growth and root  
system health and some growers inoculate their nutrient  
with commercial preparations of these for this reason.  
 
 
Organic Hydroponics  
Organically derived fertilisers such as manures are complex  
chemicals which require microorganisms to act upon  
them and break them down into simpler forms before the  
plant can take them in. Such fertilisers cannot be used in  
hydroponics unless the appr opriate microorganisms are  
first introduced to the hydroponic environment. Hydroponics is  
possible with organic chemicals if the root zone is inoculated  
with appropriate decomposing organisms, however the  
commercial potential of organic hydroponics see ms very  
uncertain in the near future -  both due to the difficulty of  
developing a biotic system that works adequately and because  
the organic industry and the hydroponic industry are not  
directly compatible in many countries.  
There are now large comme rcial - organic -  hydroponic  
growers in operations in some countries such as the USA. While  
organic hydroponics is certainly feasible from a technical  
perspective, there is still debate over whether a system that is  
completely soil - less, and is based on continuous product  
inputs, can be considered to be `organic -  since the organic  
certification is largely based on soil health and redesigning the  
production system, rather than replacing - conventional -  inputs  
for - organic -  ones.  
However in count ries such as the USA and Canada, organic  certification agencies allow the use of organically derived  
growing media such as coconut fibre, vermicast, compost,  
sawdust and ground bark. Growers often rely on bags or  
containers of such organically derived but soil -less growing  
media and feed plants on organically derived nutrient solutions  
consisting of several types of approved liquid fertilisers and  
allowable fertiliser salt inputs. Growing media is usually  
inoculated with vermicast or microbe solutions which allows  
for nutrient mineralisation in the root zone. While - organic -   
hydroponic methods can produce excellent quality and high  
yielding cr ops the degree of skill required to optimise plant  
nutrients is high and most growers rely on the use of a  
consultant experienced in this area. Any grower considering  
organic hydroponics should first check with local organic  
certification authorities i n their country to determine if soil -less  
systems are allowable under their standards. Organic produce  
can receive good returns if quality is high and organic  
certification is achieved by the grower.  
 
The Nutritional Value  
of Hydroponic  
Produce  
Market ing hydroponic produce is fairly similar to marketing  
produce grown in other ways. However, one avenue that is being  
explored to differentiate hydroponic produce from other  
produce is the nutritional value.  
There is no conclusive evidence that produce g rown  
hydroponically is more nutritious than produce grown by any  
other method, although some studies indicate that it may be  possible. For example, Plant Research Technologies Inc. in  
California, reports the following:  
-  Tomatoes (Patio Pride) grown i n an Aquafarm system  
demonstrated an average increase of 50 percent in vitamin  
and mineral content. Of the 14 values tested, the hydroponic  
tomatoes showed increases in five and decreases of 25 to 30  
percent in three.  
-  Sweet peppers (Gypsy) grown in an Aeroflo system  
showed an average increase of 150 percent - increases in nine  
of the 14 values tested and equal to soil -grown in the  
remaining five. The sweet peppers tested up to 300 percent  
higher in vitamins B2 an d 
 
 
B3. A literature search including US Department of  
Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Food and  
Drug Administration publications, and reports from  
university and private industry sources on the  
nutritional content of soil -grown crops was used in the  
study.  
-  The hydroponic produce was also tested for heavy  
metals and chemical residues on the Environmental  
Protection Agency - s priority list. None were detected.  
Rick Donnan, Vice President of the Australian Hydroponics  
and Greenhouses A ssociation believes that hydroponically  
grown produce has more of a chance of being good for  
consumers -  health because there is no contact with the  
ground. This lack of physical contact reduces the risk of  
disease organisms contaminating the produce.  The nutritional value of hydroponic produce is still an  
area under research. If hydroponic produce turns out to be  
of a higher nutritional value, it may prove to be a useful  
marketing tool for commercial hydroponic growers.

 CHAPTER 5 : NUTRIENT FILM TECHNIQUE (NFT) CULTURE   
 
 
 
Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is a method of soilless  
culture where plants are grown bare rooted in long narrow  
channels which enclose a shallow stream of nutrient solution.  
The nutrient solution f lows continuously through the channel  
(being recycled from the bottom to the top end by a pump).  
The plant r oots grow into a dense mat in the channel and the  
foliage sits on top, sometimes provided with support by a  
trellis system.  
The channels are made of water -tight material such as PVC  
or plastic film. These are laid on a slight slope to allow the  
nutrien t solution f low from top to bottom (supported by a rack  
or on a bench). The channel is enclosed as much as possible, with  
openings only needed for the top growth of the plants to  
come through.  
Even though the majority of space inside the channel is air  space,  
because it is enclosed a very high level of humidity is created in  which roots can still grow (in fact this ensures adequate levels of  
oxygen in the root zone, which can sometimes be a problem  
when plants are grown in soil).  
A typical NFT syste m thus is made up of the following  
components:  
1. Gullies along which nutrient solution f lows continuously  
and in which plant roots grow.  
2. A catchment pipe into which the gullies discharge solution.  
3. A catchment tank, in which solution collects at the bottom  
of the gully system.  
4. A pump to draw the water from the catchment tank and  
return it to the top of the gully system.  
5. A deliv ery pipe to return solution from the catchment tank to  
the top of the gully system.  
6. Tanks containing concentrated nutrient solutions or acidic  
solution (which can be injected into the dilute nutrient  
solution as required to adjust the pH or nutrient levels).  
7. Sensing devices to measure pH and EC in the nutrient  
solution, connected to control devices (such as solenoid  
valves) which release additives into the nutrient solution  
when required, in order to maintain a properly balanced  
solution.  
8. Benching (or some other construction) to support the  
gullies and maintain the required slope.  
 
 
DISADVANTAGES OF NFT CULTURE  
-  If the flow of nutrient solution stops, the roots will dry  
out and become stressed very quickly.  -  In a newly planted system wh ere the channels are exposed  
to strong sunlight, they can heat up faster than the root  
zone would heat in aggregate or rockwool. (NB: The  
continuous flow of solution does have a cooling effect  
however.)  
-  NFT channels can become blocked by roots of vi gorous - 
growing plants.  
 
TYPES OF NFT SYSTEMS  
Header Tank or Direct Pumping  
The nutrient solution is normally stored in a sump or  
catchment tank which collects the run -off from NFT  
channels. The nutrient solution can be delivered from the  
sump to the top of each channel in one of two ways:  
-  Directly: where it is pumped into feeder tubes which  
supply the top of each channel  
-  Via a header tank: where it is pumped into a secondary   
tank placed a level higher than the channels. The nutrient  
solution then flows via a system of delivery tubes into  
the channels by gravity.  
The advantage of a header tank is that it will continue to  
operate for some time after the pump ceases to opera te (if  
there is some problem with the pump).  
 
Gully Construction Materials  
Some materials can have a phytotoxic effect in that  
chemicals in the material dissolve into the f lowing solution  
and deter plant growth. Gullies or channels have been  
successfu lly constructed from the following materials:  1. PVC house guttering.  
2. Square PVC plumber - s downpipe with holes cut in the top  
for plants.  
3. Circular PVC drainage pipe with holes cut in the top for plants.  
4. Corrugated fibreglass sheeting with an ove rlay of f lat plastic.  
5. Asphalt -coated wood.  
6. Folded polythene film pinned at the top to make a tube.  
7. Concrete formed into gullies on the surface of the ground.  
 
 
Polythene Gullies  
-  Polythene is totally inert and causes no phytotoxic effect on  
plant roots.  
-  Heavier gauge polythene allows gullies to be reused. Lighter  
gauge polythene is cheaper, but must be discarded after one  
crop.  
-  In England, 600 -1000 gauge polythene is us ed, black on one  
side and white on the other side. A 65 to 80 cm wide sheet is  
used. The sheet is laid out on the permanent surface (where  
levels have previously been established), with the white  
surface underneath. The sides are then folded up and sta pled  
together. The top of each end is then stapled. The nutrient  
solution is delivered by a micro irrigation tube at the top end  
and unused solution collects into a return pipe at the bottom.  
-  Black polythene (both sides) has been used, though this wi ll  
heat up the solution if exposed to the direct sunlight and can  
- cook -  the roots in a young crop over summer. Once the  
crop grows and begins to shade the plastic this problem  
disappears. In hot conditions, shading may be used in the  interim period  until the crop is large enough.  
-  Pre-creased gusset channel made from polythene sheet is  
available in some countries, including the UK. This is PVC that  
has already been folded into a channel shape which can be  
rolled out on a prepared surface and pe riodically joined  
together along the top rim through existing holes using a  
supplied clip.  
PVC Gullies  
-  Rigid PVC has no phytotoxic effect on plant roots.  
-  Flexible PVC has at times had a phytotoxic effect on plant  
roots.  
-  Rigid white PVC plumber - s pipe has often been used with holes  
cut out to insert plants.  
-  Specially designed products made from rigid PVC are  
available; for example, Vinidex Hydro  Channel which consists  
of rectangular growing channels with a variety of different  
lids and end caps.  
Concrete  
Permanent channels can be formed in concrete, and covers  
laid over the surface with holes to insert plants in.  
Concrete gully systems have be en operated successfully on a  
commercial basis in both England and the West Indies.  
 
Corrugated PVC or Fibre Glass  
Corrugated sheet, as used in roofing, is sometimes used as a  
base for NFT gullies. Solution can be fed in the top and f low  
down to the lo w points of the corrugations. A second layer needs  
to be established above to support the plants.  
 Metal Gullies  
Metal piping should not be used because it will corrode. The  
corrosion leads to impurities in the system which can upset  
pH and nutrient bal ances, clog small pipes (when f lakes of metal  
chip off) and in some cases cause toxicity to plants.  
 
Modified NFT  
A modified form of NFT often used, involves filling the NFT  
channel with a very coarse aggregate such as gravel. There is still  
a continuous f low of nutrient solution through the gully, and  
with a  
 
 
very coarse aggregate that f low is not  
impaired. Major advantages are:  
-  Moisture adheres to the aggregate. Thi s increases the  
availability of moisture in the higher layers of the channel  
and should the flow of nutrient stop, the roots will be  
kept moist for a period until the flow can be restarted.  
-  Temperature fluctuations are reduced. The aggregate  
stops t he channel heating up or cooling down so fast.  
-  The aggregate supplies support to  
the plants. Disadvantages are:  
-  As roots grow through the aggregate, these can have a  
significant damming effect on the flow of nutrient  
irrespective of how coarse the  aggregate particles are,  
particularly in longer season crops such as tomatoes.  
-  Removal of root systems from the aggregate is difficult  
and labour intensive, remaining root debris can act as a  source of root pathogens for the next crop.  
-  Aggregate such as gravel can heat up on the surface,  
resulting in a rapid rate of evaporation of water from the  
nutrient, salt build -up and stem damage.  
Solution Delivery  
Normally solution is delivered as a continuous f low; but  
sometimes it is only delivered for a few minutes, then  
stopped for 15 to 60 minutes before f lowing again. In  
the case of plants which require very good aeration, this  
intermittent supply may be used to increase aeration in the  
root zone (particularly critical in established plants where  
the roots system can clog the channel and slow down the  
water supply).  
 
Capillary Matting  
No matter how carefully constructed the base of an NFT  
channel is, you will still almost always get some fall from one  
side o f the channel to the other. Capillary matting is  
sometimes placed on the bottom of the channel to even out  
the f low of solution. The solution is soaked up by the mat  
and spread right across the channel, preventing the  
solution from f lowing on one sid e of the channel, leaving the  
other side dry.  
The capillary mat material must be absorbent, physically  
stable and chemically inert. There have been cases of  
phytotoxicity reported through the use of inappropriate  
materials for capillary matting. Materi als used successfully  
include cellulose fibre, rockwool and various artificial fibres.  
  
Channel Width and Length  
The width for a single row of plants should normally be  
between 10 cm and 15 cm. For a double row of plants, the  
channel should be 25 to 30  cm wide. Multi -channels, more  
than two rows wide, are also used at times (where there is no  
great problem with plants growing in close proximity to each  
other).  
NFT channels should not be any longer than 15 metres, although  
shorter lengths have advantages in warmer climates. This is  
because plants in the upper parts of long channels will  
remove a lot of oxygen (effect on nutrient uptake is small  
in NFT systems ) from the solution before it reaches plants in the  
lower sections. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in NFT systems  
have been recorded to fall from 7 -8 ppm to 0 ppm along  
channels as short as 10 m containing a crop with high oxygen  
requirements such as cuc umbers, zucchinis, melons, tomatoes  
and similar large plants. A lack of dissolved oxygen in the  
nutrient solution will cause wilting of plants and lower yields.  
When temperatures rise, a solution holds less oxygen. Also when  
it is warmer the plant need s more oxygen. These things combine  
to create an increased problem with oxygen supply in warmer  
nutrient solutions.  
 
Slope  
The depth of the nutrient solution in the channel should not  
normally be more than a few millimetres. The major part of  
the root mat should not be submerged in solution.  
Normally a 1:150 or greater slope is required to achieve proper  flow of solution where capillary matting is used on a flat bottom.  
If the bottom of the channel is made using corrugated sheeting, a  
stiff capillary  mat can be laid over the top allowing a free flow of  
solution along the channel below. If the bottom is flat though, the  
flow along the bottom will be slowed by the capillary mat, hence  
requiring a greater slope along the channel to achieve the same  
flow rate.  
Where a capillary mat is not used, the slope can be as little as  
1:200 to 1:250. The rate at which solution is fed into the  
channels should be as great as is possible without increasing the  
depth of nutrient solution to more than a few millim etres in  
the channel. This can only be determined by trial and error  
for each situation.  
Many growers now use shorter NFT channels with adjustable  
slope or slopes as high as 1:60 or 1:40. This allows them to  
maintain the f low of the nutrient solution at a sufficient rate and  
prevent ponding as the root mat develops and slows the f low  
of solution over time.  
 
Temperature  
Ideally a solution should be kept at between 18°C and 22°C  
for most plants. There is a danger of solutions overheating inside  
chan nels if they receive too much direct sun in the early  
stages of a crop. As the crop develops though, it will shade the  
channel and this becomes less of a problem.  
 
 
Deep Flow Technique (DFT)  
This modified NFT technique involves placing roots in a PVC  pipe which is flooded with nutrient solution and then gravity  
drained. The roots are submerged in around 4 -6 cm of  
nutrient (or 40% of the gully height) for 15 minutes. The  
solution is then allowed to drain to 1mm depth for the next  
15 minutes.  
It is imp ortant that the nutrient solution is heavily  
aerated, and that the roots never dry out or are f looded for  
too long. Aeration may be achieved by piping air bubbles  
through the solution in the sump. This method is used for  
leafy vegetables and tomato production.  
 
Aerated Flow Technique (AFT)  
AFT is a modification of DFT and involves extensive nutrient  
aeration. AFT aerates the solution more heavily than  
DFT. One wa y of achieving this is to bubble air up through  
the nutrient solution from pipes inside at the bottom of  
the channels.  
 
 
NUTRITION  
For many years it has been considered that all plants require around 20 nutrient elements for their 
growth, and some plants   
might require a few more. Less than ten elements are known to be used in large quantities, and these 
are what make up the bulk  
of any nutrient being fed to plants growing in NFT. The remaining nutrients are generally supplied in 
either tiny quantities, or not  
supplied at all. It is assumed that dust in the air or impurities in the system will supply these tiny 
quantities of minor nutrients.  
This is however not always the case, and minor nutrient deficiencies can have drastic effects on the crop 
produce d (even though  they are only needed in small amounts).  
Research has actually found that up to 93 elements are in fact needed to maximise the f lavour in fruit 
and vegetables. For  
example, potassium and magnesium are particularly important to the f lavour  of strawberries, though 
many other nutrient elements still  
have a contributing effect on the resulting quality.  
Early research by Stoughton (1969) recommended that nutrient solutions for general use in NFT should 
have the following  
levels: Nitrogen: 100  to 300 mg/litre  
Potassium: 120 to 250 mg/litre  
As with most growth requirements, plants will always have a relatively wide range of conditions that 
they can tolerate, but  
usually a narrower range which will produce optimum results.

Recommendations for nutrient concentration for tomatoes in NFT culture (UK Department of 
Agriculture)  
 
 
While plants in NFT can grow well at a range of nutrient levels it is generally not advised to run very low 
levels of major  
nutrients as the solution must contain a sufficient `reserve -  of each element to prevent depletion. For 
this reason nutrient level s  
are maintained at much higher levels than the plant requires but this allows for depletion of certain 
elements over time which are  
not typically measured on a daily or weekly basis. If levels as low as 3.7 mg/litre of potassium were 
continually run in NFT, plant  
growth would most likely be acceptable. In reality, the potassium initially applied at 3.7 mg/litre would 
be extracted by the  
plants within a day and the solution would become depleted. If levels of potassium of 150ppm are run, it 
would take s ome  
time of continual use for depletion to occur, giving a safeguard against nutrient deficiencies. Care should 
be taken with  
interpretation of data from nutrient uptake trials as they often do not apply to a practical commercial 
situation.   
 
A Note on N utrient Levels  
Plants that are going to be harvested (e.g. vegetables and  
fruits) will generally produce more quantity and better  
quality faster, if they are grown with optimum nutrient levels. In  
some instances though, excessively fast growth may produ ce a  
different texture or taste in produce, which may or may not be  
desired. Faster growing plants can also have one disadvantage,  
in that they may react faster to some adverse conditions.  
Certain indoor plants for example, may tolerate poorer light  
and air quality if they are not fed as well. Management of  
indoor plants in hydroponics might thus involve provision of less  
than optimum nutrient levels.  
 
Mixing Nutrients  
The majority of commercial growers use at least a two -part  
nutrient mix to prevent  precipitation of certain elements when  
mixed in concentrate form. Adding all elements into a single stock  
solution will cause problems in insoluble precipitates and  
should be avoided. While single mixes are available in small  
volumes for hobby systems, few if any are used commercially  
due to the expense.  
Some nutrients used in NFT will react together causing  
precipitation. For this reason, operations may need to us e  
two or three different tanks, each containing separate and  
different stock solutions which, when mixed together in a  
predetermined ratio, will produce a balanced nutrient solution.  
For example, salts which are not very soluble, such as calcium  or ca lcium sulphate, tend to precipitate out of solution very  
easily.  
A typical situation might involve three tanks:  
-  One containing calcium nitrate  
-  One containing most other nutrients  
-  And one containing diluted acids which might be a source of  
nutrie nts such as nitrogen and potassium as well as being  
used to alter pH.

 CHAPTER 6 : ROCKWOOL CULTURE   
WHAT IS ROCKWOOL -  
 
 
Rockwool is a fibrous material produced by melting rock and  
spinning it into threads. Developed in Denmark in the late  
1960s for horticultural use, it was marketed under the trade  
name - Grodan - . Its commercial use expanded throughout the  
late 1970s, especially in Western Europe for the production of  
glasshouse vegetables and cut f lowers. In Holland use of  
rockwool for vegetable and cut f lower production expanded  from 100 hectares in 1979 to 10,000 hectares in 2001.  
Today rockwool is marketed unde r several different names  
including the original - Grodan - . Along with NFT, rockwool  
systems dominate worldwide hydroponic production. Major  
crops grown in rockwool are tomatoes, cucumbers, carnations,  
gerberas, strawberries and roses.  
 
How Rockwool i s Made  
Rockwool has been manufactured as an acoustic heat insulation  
material for over 60 years. The production technology has been  
extensively improved over this period, but the basic product has  
remained virtually unchanged.  
The raw materials are natu ral rocks such as basalt, plus coke as  
the fuel. These are fed into a blast furnace through which air is  
blown so that the coke burns and lifts the temperature to  
over 1600°C. The rocks melt to form a type of lava which  
settles to the bottom of the fur nace and is tapped off.  
The stream of lava flows into a series of high speed rotors.  
These spin off molten droplets which lengthen into fibres and are  
then cooled by a blast of air. Binder is sprayed into this air stream  
which also carries the fibres clear of the rotors and deposits them  
along a production line where it is pressed, hardened, trimmed  
and finally cut into slabs. One manufacturing aspect  of the rock - 
fibre mat is that the fibres orientate in a horizontal plane. This  
has implications that are important when the material is used  
for horticultural purposes.  
 
 
Insulation rockwool and fibreglass are useless for  horticultural purposes. Howev er, the rockwool  
manufacturing process can be modified to produce a suitable  
horticultural product. The slabs of base material can be  
shaped into the specialised forms of product such as  
propagating blocks.  
 
Characteristics of Rockwool  
-  It is very li ghtweight.  
-  Most types of rockwool are approximately 5% solid  
material by volume. This leaves an enormous amount of  
space which can be filled by air, nutrients and water.  
-  Generally, it cannot be over watered (there is always  
adequate air space).  
-  The ratio of water to air in the average free -draining slab  
is frequently two parts water to one part air.  
-  It takes longer to dry out than many other growth media  
hence the chance of water stress is reduced.  
-  It is sterile. If it is to be reused, e .g. slabs in a soilless  
system, it may be sterilised with steam or chemicals. It  
will withstand low pressure steam or steam/air treatment  
but not high temperature autoclaving which tends to  
break down the bonded structure.  
-  It has excellent insulation characteristics which keep the  
root zone from getting too hot or cold.  
-  The greater the depth of rockwool, the more air it will  
hold in proportion to water.  
-  Plants can continue to extra ct water from this medium  
even when it is only at 10 to 20% of its water -holding  
capacity. This is not so with other media. With most  media, as the water is removed it becomes increasingly  
difficult for the remaining water to be extracted by the  
plant . 
-  If a rockwool slab does become over wet, excess water  
can be readily removed by tilting the slab for a short  
time.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
-  The water content (and hence the air content) of any piece of  
rockwool is influenced by the thickness of the material, the   
drainage characteristics of the surface upon which it stands,  
and the method of watering. For example, a 75 mm thick  
rockwool slab standing on polythene holds an average of 80%  
water and 17% air. The water content also varies through the  
thickness of the slab, starting from very wet at the base and  
getting drier with increasing height. The water in the  
rockwool is also only lightly bound, so is readily available to  
the plant.  
-  It is chemically inert (except that is has a very small ef fect on  
pH).  
-  It doesn - t affect the composition of nutrient formulae.  
-  It doesn - t impede the availability of nutrients from solution at  
all. 
-  Cation exchange capacity is effectively zero and the material  will not absorb or exchange nutrient ions  from solution. One  
effect is that the material can be leached clean of any solution  
it contains.  
-  Biodegradability -  rockwool is a bonded form of natural rock  
fibres. Although it can be physically broken down by  
expanding roots or by mechanical act ion, it is not  
biodegradable. It can easily be incorporated into the soil after  
use, where it should improve aeration and drainage.  
-  Rockwool has no long -term pH buffer capacity, however,  
when nutrient solution is first added there may be an initial  
small rise in pH. The rate and degree of reaction are  
dependent upon the pH and buffer capacity of the solution  
used to wet the rockwool.  
Types of Rockwool  
Rockwool can be obtained as preformed slabs or as loose flock or  
fibre material.  
Slabs  
Slabs can vary in width, length and depth. Most manufacturers  
offer a variety of sizes.  
-  Small slabs partially cut into tiny cubes are used for  
propagation. Seeds or cuttings struck in these blocks can be  
transferred to larger growing slabs or blocks by carefully  
separating the individual cubes and then planting them on or  
into the larger slabs.  
-  Deeper slabs are commonly used to grow plants which have a  
greater need for aeration, and perhaps a preference for drier  
conditions.  
-  Shallower slabs may be used for plants requiring more water.  
Rockwool slabs are used for commercial production of a large  variety of horticultural crops in differe nt parts of the world. Some  
of the more important rockwool slab grown crops are:  
1. Course grade absorbent:  
Growing: cymbidium  
orchids. Propagating:  
cucumber seeds.  
2. Medium grade  
absorbent: Growing:  
begonias.  
Propagating: tomatoes, cucumbers.  
3. Fine grade absorbent:  
Growing: cucumbers, melons, lettuce and  
tomatoes. Propagating: finer seeds and cuttings.  
4. 50% medium absorbent with 50% medium non - 
absorbent: Growing: gerberas, freesias, anthuriums and  
cymbidium orchids.  
Flock (i.e. loose rockwool , or granulate rockwool)  
 
 
Flock can be produced either in a form which is water  
absorbent or a form which repels water. It can also be  
obtained as coarse, medium or fine granules.  
-  Coarse flock has a greater water -holding capacity than fine flock.  
-  Flock can be used as a medium in itself, or alternatively,  
mixed with some other material.  
-  Absorbent types are used by themselves, but water - 
repellent flock is generally mixed wi th other materials to  
improve the structural characteristics.  
-  Coarser grades of absorbent flock are more commonly  used in hydroponic beds. Finer grades are used in  
propagation.  
Problems with Rockwool  
Algae can grow on the surface of rockwool. This ge nerally  
does not affect the crop, but over an extended period of time  
may lead to an impermeable layer developing which can stop  
water from penetrating the slab. Slabs are frequently  
wrapped in white, grey or black plastic to stop light.  
Without light , algae will not grow.  
Slabs which are on an angle will collect nutrient solution  
more at the lowest point. The high end of such slabs will  
retain less nutrient solution than the low end. The low end  
can develop a waterlogged space, and the high end a d ry  
space. As such the best space for plant growth may only be in  
the centre of the slab, rather than across the entire slab.  
If a sloping slab has nutrient solution applied to the centre,  
residual salt can accumulate on the high side of the slab.  
A majo r environmental problem with rockwool for  
commercial production is disposal of the media after use.  
Rockwool does not break down or decompose, which  
poses a problem for disposal as it cannot be composted or  
recycled in the way that organic growing media can. Most  
waste rockwool slabs go to landfill, at an expense to the  
grower. Some growers have successfully shredded waste  
slabs and incorporated th em into cropping soil or growing  
mixes, but any disposal option has an expense involved.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SYSTEM OPTIONS FOR  
ROCKWOOL CULTURE  
Whether in blocks, a slab, or f lock, rockwool is normally better  
wrapped or contained. It may be purchased as a bloc k or slab  
wrapped in plastic film; or it may be placed into a container  
such as a tray or gutter. It has also been successfully used to  
fill trays and pots.  
Generally, the base of the rockwool should always be relatively  
f lat to avoid uneven distribut ion of nutrient solution which  
creates wet and dry spots. Heating is sometimes installed under  
rockwool (e.g. electric or hot water pipe).  
Nutrient solution can be applied either to the top end of a system  
and allowed to filter through the entire system (as with NFT) or  
applied to each unit in the system through nozzles or drippers  
(eg. Each plant, slab, bed or pot). Applying solution to e ach  
unit tends to distribute the solution more evenly.  
Recirculating nutrients is an option with rockwool systems,  
although it is mostly impractical. There are some exceptions,  
however. For instance, roses have been grown in a slightly  
sloping gully fi lled with rockwool where solution is fed into  
the top, collected at the bottom and recirculated. The time delay  between irrigations is varied according to the slope, length of  
gully and environmental conditions.  
Nutrient solution is usually allowed to e ither run into the soil  
(preferably spread evenly across the entire greenhouse) or  
collected into sumps.  
The thickness of rockwool is a very important issue. If the  
slab is too thick, the top will remain very dry. If the system runs  
to waste, the weigh t of solution will push the solution at the  
bottom out -  this means that whether the slab is very thin or  
very thick, you will only have the same depth of a wet zone at  
the bottom.  
 
 
Options for Rockwool System Design  
There are many options for the des ign of rockwool  
systems. We will discuss the following:  
-  Slab Culture  
-  Hanging Gutter Culture  
-  Ebb and Flow Beds  
Slab Culture  
A commonly used system is where propagated plants, such  
as vegetable seedlings, are transferred into individual  
rockwool cubes (usually 75 mm) where they are grown on  
until well established. The cubes are then planted onto  
individually plastic - wrapped slabs of rockwool where cuts  
have been made into the pl astic. Slits are also made in the  
plastic at the bottom of the slab to facilitate drainage.  
Individual drippers are placed into each cube to supply  
nutrient solution. The excess solution runs out into a  drain. This method is almost entirely operated as  an  
open system, though nutrients could be collected if so  
desired. A collection system would however add expense,  
which may not be commercially viable.  
If there is a significant slope from slab to slab, each slab is  
best wrapped individually and irrig ated individually. If the  
slope is very slight, it may be possible to wrap two or  
more slabs together end to end, or wrap many slabs  
continuously provided a waterproof barrier is placed  
between each pair of slabs.  
Reusing rockwool slabs  
If the slab has n- t been penetrated too much by an invasive  
root system and the previous crops weren - t seriously  
affected by major root diseases and pests, it can be  
sterilised and reused. There may be a gradual loss of slab  
height after slabs have been steam steril ised. This must be  
taken into consideration when deciding if it is worthwhile  
reusing the slabs.  
 
Hanging Gutter System  
In the hanging gutter system, PVC gutters (similar to rain  
gutters) are filled with rockwool. The gutter is supported  
above the ground by a strong frame, and plants grow on  
a trellis. Because plants are off the ground, ventilation is  
very good, which reduces disease prospects. Nutrient  
solution can be fed into  the gutter at the base of each  
plant with a dripper; any excess nutrient can be run to  
waste. In this system, the gutters must be very close to  
being level.   
Ebb and Flow System  
The ebb and f low system is popular because it is easy  
to set up and easy  to use. A tank reservoir containing  
nutrient solution is located below a growing tray filled  
with rockwool. Periodically, the growing bed is f looded  
by a small pump on a timer to feed and water the plants.  
When the timer switches off, the nutrient so lution drains  
back into the tank, which sucks oxygen into the root  
zone. An overflow drain adjusts the nutrient fill height and  
ensures the system does not overflow.  
 
 
ROCKWOOL USE FOR PROPAGATION  
Rockwool propagation blocks are used to provide  
transpl ants for growing not only in rockwool systems, but also in  
aggregate culture and NFT. They are commonly made from a  
40 mm thick slab of rockwool with horizontal fibres and slits  
from the top to give individual blocks 40 mm square.  
Deeper propagation blocks are also available for propagating  
plants which require better drainage (i.e. the greater depth,  
hence greater head of water, increases aeration in those blocks).  
The only problem which can occur with propagation blocks  
relate s to them becoming too wet. This is a problem with  
some plant species if the blocks are not managed properly.  
They must be sat in or on a freely draining surface and rate of  
irrigations must be limited. Remember, young seedlings or  
cuttings are more su sceptible to poor conditions than  
established plants.   
Australian Rockwool Propagating Blocks  
Parts of the following sections on propagation are from a paper  
presented at the Australian Correspondence School - s 1985  
Summer Update Conference by Mike Hart ley of CSR Ltd.,  
manufacturers of Growool in Australia.  
Standard propagating blocks Each block is 35 mm square  
and 40 mm high, 21 blocks per sheet; 3 sheets fit into the  
Australian standard size propagating tray.  
The horizontal -fibred blocks originally gave problems with  
separation and roots growing into adjacent blocks. Similar  
problems were observed on a visit to Europe, so an improved  
propagating block was developed which had vertical fibre  
orientation, and was grooved underneath. This type of blo ck  
is less convenient to manufacture but has since proved to be very  
successful. Some advantages of this type of block are: roots grow  
vertically rather than mostly horizontally; the gap gives a  
degree of aerial pruning; and they are very easy to separ ate. 
Sheet and block sizes A major advantage of rockwool propagating  
blocks is that they can be manufactured in sheets, with  
consequent convenience and time savings. However there needs  
to be a rational basis for selecting the sheet and block sizes. In  
Australia, there is a standard nursery propagation tray which,  
while certainly not used universally, is very widely used.  
Consequently, it was decided to size the propagating block to  
fit this tray.  
The dimensions of this tray are 280 x 340 mm. After  
experimenting, the most conventional size of sheet was found to  
be one that would fit three sheets to the tray. The corresponding  sheet size was set at 266 x 110 mm, and 40 mm thick. This  is  
grooved from underneath to give three rows of 7 individual  
blocks, i.e. 21 blocks per sheet, or 63 blocks per tray. The  
blocks are each 35 x 35 mm and 40 mm high. On top of each  
block is a hole which is mainly an indication of the location of  
the block underneath. The use of a vertical fibre format makes  
the diameter of the cutting less critical.  
 
 
These blocks are packed in lots of 100 sheets, i.e. 2100  
blocks, in a carton which weighs about 10 kg.  
The original release was of only one height of block, namely  
40 mm. This was suitable for propagating indoor plants and  
vegetables. However, when used for shrubs and  
Australian native plants, it was less successful, unless care  
was taken to increase aeration by reducing water content.  
This could a lso be achieved by increasing the height of the  
block. Consequently, a 57 mm tall block was developed in  
the same 35 x 35 mm format as the standard 40 mm type.  
This tall block also suits long cuttings.  
There was also a demand for smaller blocks giving more  
per tray. In this case, a product was developed with the  
same sheet size and 40 mm height. The sheet is  
subdivided into 4 rows of 9 blocks, i.e. 36 blocks per  
sheet, or 108 blocks per tray. The ind ividual blocks are  
25 x 25 mm x 40 mm high.  
 
Propagation Applications  
Experimentation in Australia during the early 1980s led to  commercial scale propagation, initially to supply the  
following plants for hydroponic crops:  
-  Tomatoes and cucumbers from seed  
-  Roses and carnations from cuttings.  
These were very successful but highlighted important  
areas for further work. The rose cuttings needed control of  
the water content of the blocks, and liquid feeding the  
vegetables showed that some commercial f ertilisers are  
very low in iron and hence need supplementing with iron  
chelate. There were major problems with some single  
solution concentrated liquid fertilisers which precipitated  
calcium phosphate, leading to the development of  
deficiencies of bot h these elements.  
In Australia, commercial scale nursery propagation in  
rockwool was initiated by propagators who were having  
problems either with striking or transplanting. Examples of  
problem plants were Grevillea - Robyn Gordon -  and  
miniature roses . Both struck very well in rockwool and  
transplanting losses were effectively reduced to zero,  
although Grevillea - Robyn Gordon -  required careful  
management of the water content in order to give a  
reliable strike.  
Although the initial incentive for using rockwool was to  
solve problems, once propagators were using the system  
they came to realise some of the other benefits involved. One  
such was Andrew Burton, who then integrated rockwool  
into his production syste m to make maximum use of its  
benefits and consequent labour costs.  
Triggered by the need to supply soilless crop growers,  several major specialist carnation and chrysanthemum  
propagators began propagating to order in rockwool.  
A grower of tube stock com menced selling plants propagated  
in rockwool instead of by traditional methods in tubes.  
The change to propagation in rockwool was  
unannounced, however, and there was some resistance  
from customers who did not know the material. He now  
advertises some  lines as grown only in rockwool and  
provides most other lines in rockwool unless requested  
otherwise.  
Horticultural rockwool was launched onto the Australian  
market in the early 1980s. By 1985 well over 300  
different plant species had been successfull y propagated in  
rockwool propagating blocks. The range of plants grown  
extends over f lowers, indoor plants,  
 
 
vegetables, trees, shrubs and Australian native plants.  
Propagation has been initiated from a range of seeds, seedlings,  
tissue culture plants, hardwood and softwood cuttings.  
The bulk of rockwool propagation to date has been of nursery  
plants from cuttings. These have then been potted on into  
conventional potting media. A major use has been the  
propagation of vegetables for growing on in soil as well as  
soilless systems, although use with soil has been limited to date.  
Large seeds such as cucumber, zucchini, melon, sweet corn,  
legumes, etc. are normally sown direct, whereas it is usually  
more convenient with smaller s eeded vegetables to prick out  
seedlings into the block. Flower plants are propagated for  growing cut f lower crops, also for use in the soil as well as in  
soilless systems. When larger - slipper -  seeds are pushed into  
rockwool and then watered, they h ave a tendency to work  
their way out of the block to sit on the surface, which can expose  
them to drying out and severe stress. This does not happen with  
smaller seeds, or seeds with a rough seed coat.  
When plants are intended to be grown on into a soil less  
system, they are often propagated directly into a rockwool  
wrapped cube. This is often cheaper and more convenient  
than propagating into a block and later transplanting into a  
wrapped cube which has a hole to take the block.  
Propagation of Micro -cuttings from Tissue Culture  
There has been considerable expansion in using rockwool for  
deflasking tissue cultured plants. It has proved to be a very  
compatible medium for this purpose and, particularly in the  
case of micro -cuttings, it enables good sup port of these very  
small plants.  
Several trial shipments of plants using rockwool as the  
propagating and growing medium have been exported to  
countries where the import of soil and similar growing media  
is not permitted. This use could have considerable potential,  
particularly because of the beneficial effect on plant quality.  
 
Recommended Practices for Propagation Using  
Rockwool  
Because of i ts properties, the following principles need to be  
considered when using rockwool propagating blocks:  
-  Use a block size suitable for the plant you are propagating.  
-  It is desirable to place sheets of blocks in trays with an open  mesh base. Trays with  a less open base restrict the drainage.  
Moving blocks without the support of trays can increase the  
damage to plant roots. N.B. Trays can be washed in antiseptic  
and reused many times over.  
-  Thoroughly saturate blocks before using them. Preferably  
immerse in a tub of water or alternatively, use overhead  
watering, but be thorough! Then allow blocks to drain for  
several minutes before use.  
-  Practice a high level of cleanliness. Though rockwool is sterile  
when unpacked, disease can spread easily. T he propagation  
area, greenhouse, tools and equipment (and the propagator - s  
hands) should always be kept clean.  
-  Push seed into the block only as far as is needed to just cover it  
and keep it from drying out. Push a cutting in just far enough to  
keep  it standing up. The bottom of the block is the wettest and  
the young plant shouldn - t contact that part until it has started  
to grow. A seed or cutting without roots on it is more likely to  
rot if it gets too wet.  
 
 
-  Don- t let the blocks get too wet.  
- A deeper block will have a higher proportion of air to water.  
- A block sitting on a bed of course sand will become drier  
than one sitting on a surface such as concrete tor  
asbestos sheet.  
- You can reduce the freq uency of watering.  
- Bottom heat can dry out the blocks faster than would  
otherwise be the case.  
- Mist or fogging systems, or propagating in bell jars  or a tent to raise humidity may be necessary for  
some plant varieties, but these techniques can also  
affect moisture levels in the propagation block.  
-  Most irrigation methods work well with rockwool, but  
each one will need to be used in a different way with  
respect to watering frequency.  
-  Transplant the propagated plant as soon as roots appear  
in the bottom of the block. Young plants do not - hold -  as  
well in rockwool propagation blocks as they do in tubes.  
-  Transplant into larger rockwool blocks or other media  
without removing rockwool from around the roots of the  
young plant. Carefully tear  a strip of blocks from the slab  
and remove individual blocks from the strip one by one.  
Do not squeeze the cubes any more than you have to.  
Handle gently. This minimises root damage.  
-  If planting into a medium other than rockwool, recognise  
the diff erences between the two media and allow for  
those differences. If the medium you transplant into is  
more water absorbent than rockwool, it can soak the  
moisture out of the rockwool block and dry it out before  
the roots begin to grow into the new medium. As most  
of the established roots are in the rockwool, they can be  
left suffering water stress. Once the roots establish into  
the new medium, problems such as this will disappear.  
Benefits of Rockwool Propagation  
Using rockwool for propagation can be of advantage to  
all types and sizes of nurseries. Some of the benefits to be  
obtained are as follows:  
-  A wide variety of plants strike faster in rockwoo l than in  conventional media. This gives a quicker turnover in the  
nursery and hence more efficient use of propagation  
facilities.  
-  Plants propagated in rockwool can be transplanted as  
soon as the roots are emerging from the block, or even  
earlier i n some circumstances. By comparison, in a tube  
the root system has to develop sufficiently to bind the  
medium together before it can be transplanted.  
-  Rockwool is lightweight and easier to move around the nursery  
-  It is easier to insert cuttings into  rockwool. Softwood  
cuttings which need a hole to be made, for instance, can  
be simply pushed into rockwool.  
-  Transplant shock can be less than with conventional  
media provided the block is handled carefully. The  
seedling doesn - t need to be pricked out and the cutting  
doesn - t need to be bare rooted from the propagating mix  
and planted into a tube.  
-  Overall propagation cost is often less than with  
conventional media largely due to savings on labour  
costs. Time and motion studies have shown that the total  
time involved per plant for propagating in rockwool is  
less than for propagating in a conventional mix and  
potting into a tube. (Note: Rockwool propagation has  
only one stage before planting out into the hydroponic  
system. Conventional  
 
 
methods have two stages -  striking the seed or cutting, then  planting into a tube or seedling 
tray/punnet.)  The difference in strike and germination rates and time  
between a conventional peat:perlite mix (1:1) and  
rockwool.  
(Estimates based on work by staff of the Australian Correspondence Schools, and a paper presented by 
Mike Hartley of CSR as  
mentioned earlier.) These figures relate to Melbourne, Victoria.

Limitations Experienced in the  
Use of Rockwool Propagating  
Blocks  
These limitations are cited from Australian experiences, and  
many have been overcome as growers become more familiar  
with the products and their properties.  
There will obviously be cuttings which are too large for standard  
propagation blocks. If they are forced into the blocks these tend  
to split. - Dibbing -  can help, otherwise a larger block or wrapped  
cube should be used.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Propagating blocks are rarely suitable for holding plants for  
extended periods since they have rooted. If plants are fed as they  
need to be, then their roots will eventually grow int o the  
adjoining blocks. This makes them difficult to separate  
and will cause root damage at that time. A tendency to damping  
off has been reported for some plants held for long periods,  
although in some cases additional drainage has helped. The  
materi al certainly gives optimum results if cuttings are  
transplanted soon after striking.  
Transplanting rockwool blocks into soil may result in failure  
if the soil has a high draining capacity. Because the water in the  
rockwool is only lightly bound, it can be drained away before the  
plant roots have grown into the soil. Consequently care must be  
taken to keep the blocks moist after planting. This may require  
mulching and regular watering.

 CHAPTER 7 : AGGREGATE CULTURE   
 
 
 
Aggregate culture involves growing plants in a  
material made up of loose particles held in  
some type of container.  The most commonly used aggregate materials in commercial  
hydroponics are sand, perlite, gravel, coir (coconut fibre), ground  
bark, pumice, vermiculite, LECA and sawdust. Gravel differs from  
sand in that the particles are larger, however, sand and  
grave l culture are in many instances interchangeable terms.  
Sawdust culture is also of some commercial significance in  
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.  
 
 
CONTAINERS FOR AGGREGATE  
CULTURE  
Greenhouse Floor  
Here, the entire f loor of a greenhous e may be covered with sand  
or some other aggregate. The surface below the media must first  
be graded to produce a slope which will give appropriate  
drainage to a collection point from where solution can either  
be recirculated or disposed of. The graded  surface must be  
covered with a material that will keep the media clean. It may be  
concreted or covered with asphalt (Note: asphalt is cheaper than  
concrete); or covered with heavy duty PVC film laid on a bed  
of fine sand.  
 
Bag Culture  
Extensive use is now made of thick black polythene bags for bag  
culture. Such bags are UV -resistant and are available in a range of  
sizes for different crops. The bags are inexpensive and generally  
replaced between crops. They are the basis of most comm ercial  
aggregate systems -  both drain to waste and recycling  
systems. They can be used for long -term cropping and are  commonly used for the production of large ornamental plants  
such as palms; and for 12 -18 month crops such as tomatoes and  
capsicums.  
Various types of plastic -filled grow tubes, which are usually  
purchased pre -filled with aggregate such as sawdust, pumice  
or bark, are also used in the commercial hydroponic production  
of many crops.  
 
Polystyrene Boxes  
Polystyrene boxes, commonly used for packing fruit, have  
been used successfully by many commercial growers for holding  
aggregate.  
 
Raised Beds  
Generally a concrete slab is laid first, with a slope to allow  
drainage to a collection point at one end of the system. Walls can  
then be cons tructed from brick, stone or concrete. The bed is  
then filled with media.  
Note: fresh concrete will affect the pH and calcium levels in your  
media. It is necessary for concrete to be left and washed  
periodically for at least several weeks before using i t. 
 
 
Fibreglass and Plastics  
Fibreglass and rigid plastics are excellent for  
constructing aggregate beds, and have real value for hobby  
systems. Cost limits their application in commercial  
situations though.  
 Metal  
Glavanised metal troughs have been successful provided  
they are painted to stop nutrient solution reacting with  
the galvanising.  
 
Flexible Liners  
Flexible polythene film or swimming pool and agricultural  
dam lining materials can be used to line beds bui lt with  
timber, bricks, concrete or formed earth.  
 
 
ALTERNATIVES FOR DELIVERING  
NUTRIENT SOLUTION  
Nutrient solution can be applied to aggregate culture either on  
the surface of the media, or from below the media.  
 
Sub-surface Irrigation  
If nutrient is a pplied from underneath, the media must normally  
have the ability to carry solution via capillary action  
upwards. This may not work for such media as coarse sand or  
gravel, and it will not work for many of the plastic materials.  
Perlite, rockwool, vermiculite and peat all have adequate  
capillary action characteristics to work with sub -surface  
irrigation.  
Sub-surface irrigation can operated in the following ways:  
1. A bed is f looded, with a tap or valve on the drainage  
outlet b eing closed, and then the valve is opened and excess  
solution drained off.  
2. Nutrient solution is fed into the top of a bed which has  a sloping base below the media. A film of solution f lows  
across the bottom of the bed, below the media. Solution  
mov es up into the media at all points, by capillary action.  
Excess solution may drain into a sump and be recirculated.  
3. Nutrient solution is fed into the media via wicks from a tank  
containing solution below the beds or containers.  
4. Containers (e.g. pot s or foam trays) containing media are  
sat in a tray (sometimes on top of capillary matting). The tray  
is periodically f looded with nutrient solution which rises  
into the containers via capillary action.  
 
Surface Irrigation  
The most popular way to suppl y nutrient to the surface of  
aggregate media is by trickle or drip irrigation.  
Surface irrigation may alternatively use sprayers, however that  
method will wet foliage and perhaps fruit or f lowers, which  
in turn can promote fungal diseases or lead to ot her types of  
damage to the plants.  
 
Irrigation Frequency  
The frequency of irrigation is influenced by the following  
characteristics of an aggregate:  
Particle shape and porosity  
Aggregate particles which have a regular (e.g. ball -like) shape  
and a smooth surface require more frequent irrigations. If the  
particles have crevices in their surface or are porous (i.e.  
water absorbent), the frequency of irrigation will be less.  
Parti cle size  
Large particles require more frequent irrigations than smaller  particles.  
 
 
Plant requirements and tolerances  
Plants which tolerate greater variation in water levels  
can be irrigated heavily and left longer before a further  
irrigation. Plants w hich are less tolerant of such variations  
must be watered less, but more frequently to keep  
moisture levels within a narrower range of tolerance.  
Climatic factors  
Water is lost at a faster rate through evaporation in windy or  
hot conditions, or in syste ms which have water more  
exposed to the air.  
 
Irrigation and Nutrition  
A system which is irrigated less frequently has a lower  
moisture content in the media just before each irrigation  
than one which is irrigated more often. When the moisture  
content i s lower, the EC or nutrient salt concentration  
increases. (i.e. The plant has been extracting water and  
useable nutrients from the media but leaving behind salt  
residues -  the unusable parts of the nutrients. These salt  
residues when added to the normal nutrient solution  
which is left create a more concentrated solution than what  
was first applied. A further factor is the loss of moisture  
from the aggregate s urface through evaporation. The  
water which evaporates from the aggregate surface leaves  
its share of the original nutrient in the media, raising the  
concentration further.)  Plants which are less tolerant of high EC levels are perhaps  
better grown in m edia which is suited to more frequent  
irrigations, and treated that way to minimise the EC  
creeping up between irrigations.  
Sometimes nutrient solution is heated to warm the root  
zone and produce better growth. There is a danger if the  
solution is over heated. At a higher temperature, the  
solubility of nutrient salts, and effectively the EC, will  
increase. This can upset the delicate balance of the nutrient  
solution, and may in extreme situations cause nutrient  
burn to the roots of particularly susce ptible plants.  
 
Collecting Run -off 
Although it is uncommon, some aggregate bag or bed  
systems now collect and recirculate waste nutrient.  
Commercial products are available for a system of  
nutrient collection, treatment and reuse within an  
aggregate sys tem including liners, channels and collection  
trenches. In the majority of systems, excess nutrient solution  
is still collected at the lower end of an aggregate bed or at  
the bottom of a container and disposed of. Some of the  
ways this can be done are:  
Flume  
An open channel at the end of a bed which takes excess  
solution to a sump for recycling or disposal. The difficulty  
with a f lume is that being exposed to the air, algae can  
grow in the channel and foreign matter such as  twigs or  
leaves can fall in. Without a good filtration system and  
regular cleaning, this can lead to the water f low  becoming blocked.  
 
 
Collection Pipe  
Here a pipe collects excess water and coveys it to the sump. Being  
sealed, the piped doesn - t have  the same problems as a f lume.  
Do not use clear see -though pipe though, it will allow algae  
to grow on it.  
Gravel surface and sub -surface drain  
Systems which use bags or foam boxes fed with drippers  
often run the excess nutrient solution to waste. In s uch systems it  
is important to maintain a dry and clean surface below the  
container. To do this the surface must be either sealed or  
covered with a coarse, freely draining soil. In clay soils it is  
advisable to install subsurface agricultural drainage pipes to  
remove waste solution from the growing area.  
Sculpted concrete f loor  
A sealed surface under beds can be sloped so that solution  
will drain into a collection pit (or pits). Note: be careful where  
you dispose of waste solution. You can build up significant  
salt levels at your disposal point creating very real problems  
with the soil in that area. If salt levels become too high even  
weeds will not grow, and erosion could become a problem.  
 
THE MEDIA  
There is a wide range of media that can be used for hydroponic  
growing. This includes vermiculite, perlite, sand gravel, scoria,  
pumice, rockwool, expanded clay, sponge foams, expanded  
plastics, sawdust, peatmoss, coir fibre, and composted bark.  Some o f these media are less common, so are included in Chapter  
Three: Alternatives. The more common media are presented  
below.  
 
Gravel  
Particles usually vary between 3 and 15 mm diameter. Crushed  
granitic rock or porous volcanic rock (e.g. scoria) are the mo st  
commonly used materials. More than 50% of the particles  
should be less than 1cm in diameter, and there should be no dust  
or fine particles less than 1mm diameter (this fine material  
should be washed out before use).  
 
 
Calcareous rock (e.g. limestone ) should not be used  
because it will create pH shifts. This type of rock also adds  
calcium and magnesium to the solution. If calcareous  
rock must be used, pH must be monitored and regularly  
adjusted; and calcium/ magnesium levels must be lowered  
in th e nutrient solution.  
Fresh scoria has a high pH, but if weathered before use  
will drop to an acceptable level.  
Fired shale has been used for some hydroponics, however  
due to its porous nature, salt residues tend to build up to  
toxic levels in the rock and are difficult to leach out after  
a few years. Porous rock can crumble over time and is  
generally unsuitable for commercial systems.  
 
Sand  
Sand culture can use parti cles less than 1mm in diameter; if  the particles are too fine, however, the system can become  
waterlogged.  
Sand should be washed to removed chemical impurities and  
dust particles, and screened to ensure uniform particle  
sizes, before being used in hydr oponics.  
Beach sand has been used successfully in some places (e.g.  
installations in the Middle East), but only after thorough  
washing to remove salt. If beach sand is used, it should be  
chemically tested after washing and before using. Silica,  
quartz or granitic sands are best.  
It is rare that sand is calcareous, however, be aware that  
calcareous sands are not generally suitable for hydroponics.  
Note: Sand containing large amounts of shell grit may be  
a problem.  
Additives  
Perlite, peat, sawdust, ver miculite or rockwool fibre may  
be added to sand or gravel to increase the water -holding  
capacity where a crop requiring more moisture is being  
grown.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Ausperl Perlite Grobag System  Perlite is available from various suppliers around the world, pre -  
wrapped in polythene 100 -litre bags and 25 litre bags. As with  
wrapped rockwool slabs, a slit can be cut into the plastic  
wherever a plant is to be inserted, drainage holes cut in the  
bottom of the bag and nutrient solution applied through a drip  
irrigation system.  
Ausperl Grobags are an Australian product available from Orica  
Australia, 1, Nicholson Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000.  
Setting up the System  
Ausperl bags should be used under s terile conditions to  
prevent soil -borne diseases contaminating the perlite. All soil  
should be sterilised before entering the greenhouse,  
surrounding weeds should be cleared and greenhouse f loors  
should be covered with white polythene sheeting before  
setting up the system.  
When setting up the system, the bags should be laid end to end,  
ideally in double rows. They are often slightly raised, using  
polystyrene, to allow placement of root zone heating pipes.  
Each bag should have a minimum of three dri ppers which are  
connected to the feeder line. Each double row should have a  
drainage furrow placed in the middle. The bags should be  
prepared in the following way:  
-  Cut holes in the top of the bag and insert drippers.  
-  Cut one or two horizontal drainage slits to a length of 4cm,  
usually 20mm from the base of the bag (see below). The slits  
should be made on the side of the drainage furrow.  
-  Pump nutrient slowl y into the bag until the perlite is moist and  
the solution is draining out of the slits. The perlite will be moist  
enough once moisture can be squeezed out of individual  grains.  
-  Cut holes in bags and place plants in the perlite at the same  
level as for ground growing.  
Using the System  
Perlite has a very strong capillary action which ensures that  
nutrients are drawn upwards from the reservoir at the base of  
the bag. The reservoir maintains root moisture at an optimum  
level, therefore the reservoir should never be allowed to dry out.  
Excess nutrient solution runs to waste, so the perlite never  
becomes too wet.  
The depth of the reservoir is determined by the medium the  
crop is propagated in. Plants propagated in perlite, vermiculite or  
peat should  have slits cut 20mm from the bottom of the bag.  
Plants propagated in rockwool blocks require an initial slit to be  
made 75 mm from the bottom to prevent too much water being  
drawn from the block. Once roots are established (usually within  
2 weeks), th e slits can be lowered to the normal 20mm  
height.  
With good quality water, 10% of the solution should run to  
waste. EC levels should be checked regularly; if they increase  
above set limits more solution should be run to waste at each  
feed. If the solution EC still does not decrease, the EC of the input  
solution should be reduced (not more than 0.5 mS/cm).  
Flushing should only be done with dilute solution, not water, as  
the roots cannot tolerate the sudden change in solution  
concent ration.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 8 : OTHER TECHNIQUES -  SELECTED EXAMPLES    
 
 
WICK SYSTEM  
A wick system uses a cord or fibrous piece of material which  
has the ability to absorb nutrient solution and raise it upwards by  
capillary action. Capillary action is the force which makes liquid  
travel upwards against the force of gravity. This is the same force  
which causes liquid paraffin to soak up a wick in a paraffin  
lamp and supply fuel from the bottom to the fire burning at  
the top.  
A typical wick system involves the supply of nutrient solution to  
an aggregate bed from a reservoir of nutrient solution below the  
bed. Another method uses pots standing in a tray of nutrient  
solution. Here a wick material such as rockwool can be pushed  
through the drainage holes in the  base of the pot so that some  
goes into the pot and some hangs out of the bottom. The pots are  
filled with a medium such as sand, and then planted. The trough  
is supplied with nutrient solution which soaks up the wick to  
moisten the sand.  
 
BAG CULTURE  
Plastic bags with drainage holes are used to hold hydroponic  
media. Nutrients are supplied by a trickle or drip irrigation  
system outlet to the top of each bag. Drainage holes at the  
bottom of the bag allow any excess to drain away.  
In the p ast, bag culture nutrient solution was run to waste.  
These days, however there are environmental issues with simply  
running the solution to waste. Thus many growers are forced to  collect and reuse the waste. Such bag systems can be made to  
work well as  a recirculating system provided the nutrient is  
managed and sterilised where necessary. Dutch growers are  
legally bound to using recirculating bag and media systems, as  
opposed to the drain -to-waste system. Normally only one plant  
is grown in each bag , and bags are spaced at intervals according  
to the requirements of the plant variety being grown.  
 
 
In a well managed and monitored bag system, the nutrient  
strength and application is controlled to prevent and salt  
build -up on the surface of the media . Leaching or flushing  
with water is not advised as it can cause rapid changes in the  
electro conductivity (EC) around the root system (osmotic  
potential in the root zone) which can lead to the plant taking  
up large volumes of water which results in pr oblems such as  
fruit splitting in crops such as tomatoes. (Osmotic potential  
is the potential for water to move from one area of low salt  
concentration to an area of high concentration. E.g. Water  
on the surface of fruit, which has low salt concentrati on,  
moves through the fruit skin to the inside where  
concentration is higher, resulting in swelling and maybe  
cracking of the fruit).  
Bags must sit on top of a surface that drains freely and  
remains relatively dry so that roots do not grow out  
through the holes in the bottom of the bag. They should  
never sit on top of soil. In the US bags are often sat on  
plastic sheeting. They can also sit on coarse gravel, a sealed  
surface such as asphal t or concrete, or on a couple of bricks.  Bag culture is used commercially in many countries  
including parts of North America. The major advantage  
of this technique is its establishment cost. It is perhaps one  
of the least expensive methods to set up.  
 
Dutch Bucket System  
Also known as the Bato system, this system was developed in  
Holland, and is used to grow a range of plants including  
commercial tomato production in the US and other  
countries. The system is based on a series of media -filled  
planters  (Dutch buckets), each fed by an emitter joined to a  
main supply line which is connected to a reservoir filled with  
nutrient solution.  
The nutrient solution drains through the medium and  
any excess is drained from the buckets to the central  
PVC return pipe to be recirculated. Suitable media for this  
system include perlite, rockwool cubes, vermiculite and coir.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Column Culture  
This involves growing plants in vertical tubes with slits or  
holes cut in the sides for plants to grow through. Nutrient  
solution is applied to the top and allowed to filter through  
the medium to the bottom from where it is either run to waste  or colle cted and recirculated.  
The principal advantage is more plants can be grown in a  
specified area. However, there are two disadvantages of growing  
plants in column culture. The first is that there is a lack of light  
reaching the lower layers of the system -  this has been noted in  
many vertical strawberry systems. The second is the effect of  
gravity which can result in lower sections of the medium  
being wetter (due to the weight of water above). This system is  
generally not used for commercial growing. Where it is, drainage  
and ample light are key factors in the success of the system.  
 
Luwasa  
Luwasa is a European company which produces pots fed by  
capillary action via a store of nutrient solution held in a reservoir  
below the medium. The Luwasa system  is sold as a kit, with a  
decorative plastic pot and built -in reservoir, a pack of aggregate  
(expanded clay), a supply of nutrients and instructions.  
The system has some applications for commercial interior  
plantscaping, but is not appropriate for crop production.  
 
 
SAWDUST CULTURE  
Sawdust culture is a hydroponic method practiced by  
growers on a commercial scale in Canada, the USA, New  
Zealand, Australia and other countries where sawdust is  
cheap and of reasonable quality when fresh.  
In these areas sawdust culture is practiced in greenhouse  
growing, either using beds or bag culture. Common wood  
sources have been Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir),  Tsuga heterophylla (Western hemlock) and Pinus radiata  
(Radiata Pine). Thuja plicata sawdust is toxic and should  
not be used.  
Beds are commonly built as follows:  
1. The ground surface is sculpted to form a channel with  
a slope along its length and a - U-  or - V-  shape in cross  
section.  
2. Timber slabs are fixed on the edges of the depression.  
3. Plastic sheet (or something similar) is laid into the  
pit and fixed to the tops of the timber walls.  
4. A 5 cm drainage pipe is run along the length of the  
pit/bed on top of the plastic.  
5. The pit  is then filled with sawdust to a depth of 20 -30 cm.  
Because sawdust has a good cation exchange capacity,  
nutrient solution has been supplied in a rather  
unconventional way. Before filling the bed with sawdust,  
the nutrient is mixed into the sawdust. Af ter that the crop is  
irrigated with a different nutrient formulation, supplying  
only nitrogen and potassium. Sufficient micronutrients,  
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium remain in the  
sawdust to supply the crop - s needs until harvest.  
Alternatively, nutrient can be applied as with other  
hydroponic systems -  i.e. a full nutrient solution with  
every irrigation.  
There is a real danger of salt build -up to toxic levels in  
sawdust culture. Conductivity (EC) readings need to be  
taken regu larly, and for most crops, at levels of 4.0 mS/cm or  
higher, the system needs to be leached through with water.  
There are other problems with sawdust culture. For  example, sawdust is organic and is used unsterilised. This  
means that it will start to bre ak down over time. Typically,  
sawdust in hydroponics first breaks down in the base of the  
growing bag or bed, where the grower is not aware of the  
problem. This area becomes saturated as the decomposing  
material loses its open structure and oxygen depl etion  
occurs. This in turn often causes some degree of root die  
back in the base of the container and the effect on the crop  
can range from wilting due to a lack of oxygen, to mineral  
deficiencies as the plant is unable to take up sufficient  
nutrients  due to stress in the root zone. Other problems  
include fruit and f lower drop.  
 
 
AEROPONICS  
by Keith Maxwell, MSc Agr., JP  
World Councillor and Aust. Rep ISOSC  
The International Society for Soilless Culture in their  
classification of systems and methods  of soilless culture (Steiner,  
A.A. 1976) defined aeroponics as - The system where the roots  
are continuously or discontinuously in an environment saturated  
with fine drops (a mist or aerosol) of nutrient solution - . 
Many people, worldwide, consider the future of successful crop  
production lies in a universal cropping system which can be  
used efficiently. Perhaps aeroponics is the answer -  This type of  
culture is widely used in laboratory studies in plant physiology  
because of the unique opportunities for studying plant  
growth and development.  
Practical applications in the field have not been commercially  demonstrated, except on a very limited scale in It aly and Israel.  
Complexity of design, costs, and maintenance requirements have  
been considered to the primary factors against wider acceptance  
compared to other systems.  
Many researchers consider that only - true hydroponics -  (that is,  
using bare -root ed plants) gives the grower full control over  
the root parameters and thereby a possibility of optimising the  
growth of plants compared to solid substrate culture.  
Aeroponic systems differ from other hydroponic systems in two  
main ways. Firstly no inert  medium is required and secondly the  
nutrient solution is provided by direct sprinkling to the  
roots.  
The first aeroponic system was evolved at the University of Pia in  
Italy by Dr Massantini. This lead in the 1960s to the  
development of the - colonna di coltura - . This consisted of an  
aeroponic pipe supporting three relatively small cultivation trays  
fitted with sprinklers and covered with polystyrene lids. A  
range of plants was grown quite successfully but it was  
expensive.  
 
Technical Aspects  
Aeration  
The importance of an adequate supply of oxygen to plant roots,  
particularly in water culture, has been well established.  
Depletion of oxygen will have an adverse effect on cropping.  
Over 50% of the dry weight of the plant is made up of  
oxygen. Much of it is taken up directly from the air through the  
leaves but an important part comes from the oxygen dissolved in  
the water around the roots. If this supply of oxygen is  diminished or cut off the plant will die.  
The only practical way in which ox ygen can enter the water is by  
diffusion and this can be assisted by mechanical methods which  
increase the water surface area. In general, aeroponic  
misting has no problem with oxygen deficiency, but with high  
pressure aeroponic systems it is technical ly impossible to keep  
the atomising nozzles clean; also these systems have high energy  
costs to operate. Another problem is that with plants having  
big root systems, such as tomatoes and cucumbers, a larger  
and expensive - root chamber -  is needed.  
In order to have a perfect exchange of oxygen, a loose root  
system is needed together with adequate water.  
 
 
Water Supply  
Any system of agriculture is limited by the quality of the  
water and this is especially important with hydroponics.  
In general, any dri nking water can be used, but brackish or  
very - hard -  water should be avoided. If there is any  
doubt a water analysis should be arranged.  
The use of dam water for hydroponics is not recommended  
because of the commonly present Pithium and Fusarium  
fungi which can cause disease problems. If such water is  
used it must be freed from these fungi either physically  
through filtration or chemically.  
 
The Schwalbach System  
Today there are many hydropon ic techniques available,  
which often makes it difficult for the grower to decide what  is the best to experiment with before making the final  
decision. In general, with the increasing knowledge  
available, the systems tend to be more technical and thus  
expensive.  
An inexpensive and technically simple method has been  
developed by Keith Schwalbach, in NSW, Australia. The  
essentials of the Schwalbach system are:  
1. Water supply. The water used in Schwalbach - s  
system came from an earth dam where there wa s no  
special provision to prevent contamination. This was  
the only water available and had to be used despite  
adverse comments in general for this type of water  
supply. The water was tested by the NSW Department of  
Agriculture and found to be suitable  for hydroponics and  
general farm use, including livestock.  
The water was piped to a 200 -litre plastic tank in which  
the nutrients were mixed.  
2. Nutrient. A general purpose ready -mixed nutrient was used.  
3. Nutrient tank. The nutrient solution was then  
transferred to the 200 -litre plastic tank to which the  
circulatory pump was connected.  
4. Pump. The pump used was a Mono, quarter  
horsepower, slow -revving pump which proved to be  
capable of servicing approximately 60 jets and was  
still able to bypass some unwanted pressure back to  
the drum. The desired pressure required was about 100  
kpa. Each jet needs to deliver approximately 10 litres per  
hour. Because pumps are expensive an d critical to the  
operation, it is recommended that a pump expert be  consulted.  
5. Growing benches.  
i) Bench top. The design has many desirable features.  
In the early stages marine plywood tops were  
used but found  
to be unsuitable. These were replaced with  
structural foam polypropylene benches. This type  
of plastic has many advantages as it is rigid, acid  
and alkaline resistant, tolerates a wide range of  
temperatures, is UV stabilised and - food  
compatible - . The expected life of this plastic top  
compares well with other types, both because of the  
above properties and the thickness of 6 mm.  
The tops are curved to allow rain water to run off  
quickly, keeping them as dry as possible and almost  
eliminating nutrient dilution. The concave  
undersurfa ce allows for a better trajectory of the  
spray and the curvature gives greater  
 
 
strength. They are designed with pockets to take hoops  
so a mini igloo or shade cloth can be easily erected. The tops  
are interlocking and channelled so nutrient remains in the  
root chamber.  
ii) Root chamber. The frame was made form 18 mm square  
galvanised pipe. The cladding of the root chamber was 2  
metre -wide black PVC plastic sheeting.  
6. Misting apparatus. The nutrient was fed off into each root  
chamber by a 13 mm black PVC pipe and jets were inserted in  the appropriate places, preferably with a cut -off valve  
before each enters the chamber to facilit ate servicing. The  
run-off nutrient gravitated back to the nutrient pump  
tank. The jets used were Wingfield misters RMST, capable  
of using 21 litres per hour at 22 psi. In the Schwalbach  
system the pressure was reduced to 12 to 14 psi, delivering  
appr oximately 11 litres per hour per jet. This resulted in the  
optimum trajectory and gave the most desirable spray, and  
also allowed more jets to be serviced by an individual pump.  
7. Growing routine. Healthy seedlings with their small roots  
protruding are  placed in the holes in the bench tops. If  
extreme weather is expected and appropriate cover could be  
drawn over the hoops of the mini igloo to improve the  
micro environment at very minimum cost. Within a day or  
two the all -important healthy - water ro ots-  will have  
developed, matched by an equally healthy top growth.  
Plants can easily be relocated at any stage of their growth or  
left until the root becomes too extensive.  
A characteristic of the aeroponic system is the astonishing  
growth rate of the  root systems and the crops. For example,  
lettuce roots have been measured at 400 mm length after 21  
days, 700 mm after 35 days and, at maturity, 42 days, measured  
in excess of 1000 mm. Tomato roots measured more than 2 m  
after 74 days.  
Other observations made by Schwalbach which illustrate the  
success of this rather simple system include lettuce variety  
Imperial which, at maturity, measured 60 -69 cm across the ou ter  
leaves and 23 -26 cm across the very firm heart. Another  
example was the egg -shaped type of tomato which yielded  more than 20 kg of good quality fruit during its 28 weeks  
growth cycle. Other vegetables grown successfully include  
parsley, silverbeet , celery, cabbage, Blue Lake stringless beans,  
strawberries, Mignonette and other fancy lettuce. As an  
experiment miniature watermelons and rockmelons and a few  
species of f lowers all grew well.  
Despite using dam water, a range of healthy, good quality   
vegetables were produced using Schwalbach - s system. The  
growth cycles, in general, were much shorter than for similar  
crops grown in soil.

RAFT SYSTEM  
Raft systems are popular for the commercial production of  
lettuce, salad crops and herbs that do not require much  
support. In this system, plants are grown on a f loating raft  
that rests on the surface of a shallow tank filled with aerated  
nutrient sol ution. The raft is commonly made from  
polystyrene foam sheets, with holes drilled through the sheets  
to allow the roots to dangle in the aerated solution.  
The system is well suited to outdoor production in mild  
climates or covered by simple cloches or c rop covers.  
 
SELF WATERING POTS  
Planter Technology - s container irrigation system consists of self  
watering pots with an innovative design to regulate water  
supply to the plant root -zone. The pots consist of a reservoir and  
self- irrigating apertures that supply water directly to the  
plant root zone. Water supply is regulated by a vacuum -sensor  
that precisely monitors the soil moisture level.  These self -irrigating pots are suitable for all kinds of potted  
plants, and can be used for home hydroponics systems. Indoor  
and outdoor models are available, as well as kits to convert  
existing planter pots to vacuum -sensor self irrigating  
systems.  
The Planters are  distributed in Australia and New Zealand

AUTOPOT SYSTEM  
By Andrew McIntyre  
There are a variety of Autopot hydroponic growing units  
available, all generically referred to as Autopot systems ®. The  
common component in all Autopot growing units is the  
Smart -valve®, a liquid level control device that controls the  
allocation of nutrient solution to a growing container. Invented  
in Australia, and originally designed for hobby growers, two  
Autopot systems have been adopted for commercial production  
by a limited number of vegetable growers both in Australia and  
internationally -  Autopot system hydrotray units and capillary  
tables.  
 
Capillary tables  The capillary table is a growing tray, covered with cotton -based  
capillary matting, over which lays porous weed mat. When  
open, the Smart -valve allows nutrient soluti on to run down  
moulded channels in the tray, from where it is absorbed by  
the capillary mat. Growing containers or media blocks (such  
as rockwool cubes) are placed on the tray,  
 
 
and transport of nutrient solution to the plant roots occurs  
by capillary  action. The capillary tables can be gravity -fed  
nutrient solution from a tank, or pump -fed nutrient solution  
from an Autopot Dosing Unit. A heating board may be  
placed under the tray to warm the nutrient solution.  
 
Hydrotray units  
The hydrotray unit co nsists of a tray that fits two 10 -   
growing containers, and a Smart -valve in a central cavity  
between the two growing containers. When open, the Smart - 
valve allows nutrient solution to fill the tray to a level of 35  
mm, and transport of nutrient soluti on to the plant roots  
occurs by capillary action in the media in each growing  
container. Hydrotray units can be gravity -fed nutrient  
solution from a tank, or in a commercial situation, any  
number of hydrotray units could be pump -fed nutrient  
solution from an Autopot Dosing Unit.  
Elmac Hydroponics, a commercial hydroponic farm in  
Australia used capillary tables to grow seedling cherry  
and table tomato plants, which were later transplanted into  
Autopot system hydrotrays. Seagull Group in Maldives  uses capillary tables both to grow seedling vegetable  
plants, which are later transplanted into other production  
systems, and to grow lettuce through to harvest. Seagull  
Group also uses hydrotr ay units to produce a range of  
vegetable and herb crops including lettuce, tomato,  
capsicum, Chinese cabbage and basil. Autopot system  
hydrotray units are also used for commercial production  
of vegetable crops on farms in Paraguay, Mauritius and  
China . 
The Smart -valve method for controlling the allocation of  
nutrient solution to plants makes the Autopot systems  
unique, because it allows the plants in each growing  
container to dictate their own irrigation cycle based on  
water demand. The Smart -valve  method is also extremely  
water efficient because the only wastage of water in the  
Autopot system is through evaporation from the surface  
of the growing container. However, because there is no run - 
off of nutrient solution from the growing container, th ere is  
the potential for accumulation of nutrient salts in the  
growing media, as noted during tomato production in both  
Australia and Maldives. Each time the Smart -valve opens,  
any accumulated nutrient salts might be re -dissolved  
into the fresh nutrient solution, changing the formulation  
and concentration of the solution. To date, insufficient  
research has been carried out on determining the optimum  
nutrient formulations and concentrations for using the  
Autopot system for commercial vegetable production.  
 
  CHAPTER 9 : HYDROPONICS EQUIPMENT   
 
 
 
IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT  
Nutrient solution can be applied in many different ways to a  
hydroponic system. It may be fed into the top of t he media via an  
irrigation line or into the bottom of the media via absorbent  
wicks. It may also be supplied by f looding and draining off the  
excess, or by a continuous or intermittent f low through the  
bottom of the root zone.  
Once applied, excess nu trient can be allowed to be lost but  
these days most growers collect and recirculate the solution  
through the system.  
There are no hard and fast rules, and the best method may be  
different in any given situation.  
 
Pumps  
Pumps are used in hydroponics for  moving nutrient solution  
through the system. There are two main types of pump which  
can be used for irrigation systems:  
1. Centrifugal pumps. These operate through water being forced  
along driving propellers which are attached to a rotating  
shaft. This force creates pressure as water f lows out to the  
discharge pipes. They are usually located above the water  
source. Water enters the pump through a suction pipe. The  
pump must be pri med to remove air bubbles in the suction  
pipe.  
2. Turbine pumps. These work by water rotating a driving  propeller inside a bowl which creates the water pressure.  
Vertical turbine pumps draw water from a water surface.  
Submersible turbine pumps have the  motor located below the  
pump in a well.  
Pumps which are used for fertilising are known as positive  
displacement pump injectors. These injectors automatically  
add the correct amount of nutrient solution to the main supply  
line during irrigation.  
Pumps used in hydroponics must be:  
1. Non -corrosive. If nutrient solution contacts metal parts it can  
corrode and block irrigation lines.  
2. Reliable. Breakdowns (particularly in recirculating systems  
such as NFT) can result in serious crop losses.  
3. Powerful . Do not even come near to overloading a pump.  
Always buy something a little more powerful, operating at its  
maximum workload, than you will need.  
 
Dripper Systems  
Drip irrigation is perhaps the most popular way of supplying  
nutrient solution to commerc ial rockwool or aggregate  
systems. Drip systems supply water in a steady slow trickle  
to the base of each plant. This ensures that each plant is  
receiving a uniform supply of water at the optimum levels  
for plant growth. It also means the system is very water  
efficient.  
The system is based on the construction of a main supply line of  
PVC pipes (eg. 3 -5 cm diameter) which are connected to  
latera l 
  
feed lines (eg. 2 -2.5 cm diameter). The individual drippers  
are attached to 1 cm f lexible polyethylene pipes which  
come off the feed lines. Each irrigation takes several hours,  
using low water pressure (100 kpa).  
Microjets, which release a much lar ger volume of water  
in a shorter period of time, can be used as an alternative  
means of emitting solution. Drippers are prone to  
blockage through build - up of algae and sediments. Filters  
will reduce this problem, and careful management of your  
nutrie nt solutions will minimise precipitation of low  
solubility chemicals.  
The major consideration with dripper systems is that every  
dripper operates at the same rate and therefore supplies  
equal amounts of nutrients to each plant. This should be  
achieved by correct layout of pumps, main and distribution  
lines. In situations where this is difficult to achieve, it is  
possible to compensate by putting in more drippers per unit  
area to places with reduced f low rates. Irrigation lines and  
drippers should b e cleaned between crops using acid  
solutions, according to the manufacturer - s suggestions.  
 
SOLENOID VALVES  
A solenoid valve is a valve which can be opened and  
closed by using an electric signal. A solenoid can be installed  
to operate as a tap connecting a tank holding nutrient  
solution into the irrigation line. An EC meter in the  
irrigation line may, for instance, determine that nutrient  
levels have dropped too low, and then transmit a signal  opening the solenoid and releasing concentrated nutrient.  
As the nutrient concentration rises in the irrigation line,  
the EC meter detects the change and at a given point  
will shut off the solenoid, stopping any furt her release of  
nutrient. This is of course only one example of how a  
solenoid might be used in hydroponics.  
 
NUTRIENT CONTROLLERS  
Total salts concentration is determined by measuring  
electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution. This needs to  
be mo nitored closely as the nutrient concentration will be  
continually dropping due to nutrients being taken out  
and used by the plants growing in the system. An EC meter  
(electroconductivity meter) is a device which measures the  
flow of electricity between  two electrodes. If the  
concentration of salts in the solution is stronger, there will  
be a stronger flow of electrons.  
An EC controller monitors and shows the EC level in the  
solution at all times, and operates injection pumps which  
add concentrated n utrient solution to the solution in the  
system when the level falls.  
EC will increase if temperature increases. Because of this, it  
is necessary to provide temperature compensation in the  
salinity control system. This is usually calculated on the  
basis of 2% per degree centigrade.  
An EC controller automatically compensates for EC drop  
bringing it back to a predetermined level, thus  
maintaining optimum nutrient levels at all times.  
Over a  period of time, there can be build -up of unused  salts (ie. parts of the nutrient solution chemicals which  
are not used). This can create an inappropriate EC  
reading which will make  
 
 
it necessary to make adjustments to the setting on your EC  
controlle r. Alternatively the solution needs to be replaced with a  
fresh solution or the system f lushed out with water.  
Although EC controllers can maintain nutrient solutions for  
periods at optimum levels, it is advisable that chemical  
analysis of the nutrient  solution (for nitrogen, potassium,  
calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron) also be carried  
out from time to time. In large commercial operations, such a  
chemical analysis should be undertaken at least every two weeks.  
Many commercial growers carry ou t on-site nutrient analysis  
with the use of portable equipment of various types, as it takes  
several days for most labs to return a full nutrient analysis -   
often too long when nutrient changes are occurring rapidly in a  
crop.  
 
PH CONTROLLERS  
pH (ie. the level of acidity or alkalinity) is critical to the  
growth of many plants. Different plants prefer to grow within  
different limits of pH. Most plants prefer a pH range of 5.5  
to 6.5.  
A pH controller is a device linked to an electrode in the  
catchment tank. The electrode measures the pH of the  
nutrient solution and relays the reading to the controller. The  
controller can be programmed to inject predetermined amounts  of acidic or alkaline solution into the catchment tank if the pH  
reaches a n upper or lower limit. This way, the pH of the  
solution can be brought back to a level which is suitable for  
the plants being grown.  
If the nitrogen supply in the solution is predominantly  
potassium or calcium nitrate, the pH will rise during  
cropping  and acid needs to be added periodically to bring the  
level back to something reasonable. If the pH drops below 5.0,  
there can be problems with corrosion of parts in the pump.  
Usually nitric or phosphoric acid are used to correct high pH in  
nutrient sol utions. They are premixed 1:10 or 1:20 with water  
and injected into the catchment tank as required, allowing  
maximum mixing to occur before the adjusted solution is  
delivered to the plants. A 10% solution of potassium hydroxide  
is used to raise pH leve ls. 
When mixing concentrated acids, always add the acid to the  
water. It can be very dangerous adding the water to the acid.  
pH probes need regular cleaning and calibration and most  
have a life limited to 12 months. pH probes are a major cause of  
incorr ect pH readings as they have a tendency to drift and  
become inaccurate much more rapidly than EC probes. pH  
standard solutions and calibration solutions should be obtained  
and used weekly to check and correct pH problems.  
 
 
TIME CLOCKS  
These can range from simple mechanised versions to  
advanced programmable electronic types that are suitable  
for multiple operations. They can provide a simple means of  automatically control ling such tasks as turning water  
supplies on and off and adding nutrients. The main problem  
with such clocks is that they operate on a particular  
schedule as set by the operator and don - t have a  
monitoring capability that allows them to adjust the  
timing of their operation according to the plant - s  
requirements.  
 
COMPUTER CONTROLS  
Increasingly commercial and even many amateur  
hydroponic growers are using computerised systems to  
undertake tasks such as controlling, monitoring and  
recording informat ion relating to environmental  
conditions in the growing area, to the volume and timing  
of water applications and the pH and conductivity of both  
the input and runoff solutions. Specific hydroponic growing  
computer programs have been developed that can be used  
on inexpensive personal computers. A good program can  
greatly reduce the time and effort expended by the  
grower in obtaining the optimum growing conditions for  
his crops.  
Specific applications that can be undertaken using  
computerised systems include:  
1. Monitoring input solution pH so that when the required  
pH range, as set by the grower, is breached then a  
command is sent to a dispenser, such as an injector, to  
add an  acidic or alkaline solution to the input solution to  
adjust the pH to the desired level.  
2. Monitoring the conductivity of the input solution,  particularly for recirculating systems, to either signal  
a warning to the grower or to send commands to  
either: 
a) Add more nutrients when EC readings are lower  
than the desired level or  
b) To f lush more water through the system to leach out  
excess salts when EC readings are too high.  
3. Monitoring and controlling, within required levels,  
environmental facto rs such as air and root zone  
temperatures, humidity, light intensity etc. This can be  
achieved via the computer controlling air vents, heaters,  
misting systems and other automated equipment.  
4. Controlling and monitoring the frequency and volume  
of wat er application, and monitoring water runoff in  
run-to waste systems as a means of determining  
water use.  
5. Providing a record of environmental conditions  
experienced and nutrients used in producing each  
crop.  
Additional information such as crop yields  and  
production times can be added manually to the computer  
record to provide a complete crop history for future  
reference.  
Research in Europe and the US has also indicated the  
potential of such systems to monitor and control the level of  
individual nutrients, and that this could be extended to  
adjust required nutrient levels to match differing weather  
conditions.

 SUMPS/STORAGE TANKS  
Tanks are frequently too small for the system they are used in.  
The size of the tank depends on:  
-  How much water the plants uses (fast -growing crops use more)  
-  How much water is lost through evaporation (depend s on  
temperature in the growing environment)  
-  Method of applying nutrient solution (capillary feed results in  
smaller losses through evaporation  
-  Whether you are using a closed or run -to-waste system  
-  Type of medium (media such as perlite or rockwo ol which  
retain a lot of moisture require less frequent irrigations than  
media such as coarse sand).  
As a general guide:  
In aggregate culture -  91 litres (20 gal) per square metre of  
growing area in cool climates; 136 litres (30 gal) per square  
metre in warm climates.  
Volume should be enough to completely fill the beds one and one -  
third times (ie. liquid volume plus the volume of solids in the  
media equals the total volume of the tank plus 33%).  
A tank 5450 litres (1200 gal) in size will supply a gr avel bed  
105 m x 0.6 m x 0.3 m deep (350 ft x 2 ft x 1 ft).  
 
Materials for Tanks  
Metal tanks (even galvanised) are not recommended.  
Chemicals in the nutrient solution make metal tanks more  
susceptible to corrosion than metal tanks which hold drinking  
water.  
Concrete. The major disadvantage of fresh concrete is its lime  
content, however, weathering before use will eliminate this  problem. Here are a few ideas for concrete tanks:  
-  A large concrete pipe turned on end and concreted in the base  
is a relatively inexpensive way of making a tank.  
-  A septic tank, or prefabricated water tank are other alternatives.  
Fibreglass or plastic. A variety of prefabricated tanks are  
available, some desi gned for holding water or chemical  
sprays, some for other purposes. These are ideal for hydroponic  
systems but can be relatively expensive.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 10 : GREENHOUSE OPERATION   
 
 
 
Greenhouses are used to control the growing environment -   
therefore the y regulate plant growth. They can make the  
following possible:  
-  Growing a crop out of season  
-  Growing a crop faster  
-  Growing a crop in a locality unsuited to that crop  
Hydroponic culture in a greenhouse has the added advantage  
that the nutrient solution does not become diluted by  
rain.  
Though greenhouses are normally used to keep plants  
warmer than the outside environment, they may also be used to  
regulate other aspects of the environment including:  
-  Cooling  
-  Light -  day length and/or intensity  
-  Balance of gases in the air - in particular carbon dioxide  -  Exposure to pest and disease organisms  
GREENHOUSES  
A greenhouse is an enclosure made of material transparent/  
translucent to solar radiation. The covering limits the  amount of  
heat loss due to convective cooling by the wind, as well as  
reflecting some long wave radiation emitted by the crop and  
air (depending on the cover material). Consequently, when the  
sun is above the horizon, temperatures build up with heat  
being transferred to the air, providing significant improvement  
in the growth of the crop.  
A greenhouse responds very rapidly to outside conditions such as  
changes in solar radiation levels or cooling temperatures at night.  
Without heating most greenhou ses fall to within 1 to 2°C of the  
outside temperature within two hours of sunset.  
Greenhouses fall into the following categories:  
-  Glasshouses. These have glass walls (at least in part); they are  
very effective, long lasting and expensive.  
-  Fibregla ss houses. These are made from fibreglass sheets;  
they are cheaper, are not as well as insulated as glasshouses,  
and have a medium lifespan.  
-  Coreflute/solar sheet houses. These are medium cost, have a  
medium lifespan (15 years plus), and provide more effective  
temperature control than PVC or fibreglass houses.  
-  PVC film (polythene houses). These are made from polythene  
film, normally over a metal framework (usually a tunnel). They  
are very cheap bu t last only a few years before requiring cover  
replacement. Insulation is poorer than other coverings.  
Other equipment used for environmental control in growing  
beds:  -  Hotbeds - Heat is provided in the base of a bed (box  
arrangement) by means of elect ric heating cables, hot water or  
steam pipes, or hot air flues. The bed needs to have drainage  
outlets and be made from a material which will not rot (ie.  
brick, concrete, treated timber, etc). An ideal size is 1 m x 2 m  
(3 ft x 6ft). The hotbed is fil led with 8 -10cm (3 -4 inches) of  
coarse propagating sand or perlite.  
-  Coldframes - A coldframe is similar to a hotbed except it is  
not heated and has a cover/top made from glass, plastic,  
fibreglass or similar material. Coldframes can be placed  
inside  or outside a  
 
 
greenhouse. A simple coldframe can be built for a very  
low cost and can be used effectively to strike cutting or  
germinate seed (though not as effectively as heated  
beds).  
-  Shadehouses - Use for protecting young plants, usually  
after removal from the propagating area and planting up  
into the first container. Shadehouses allow for plants to  
be gradually eased out of their highly protected  
propagating area to the harsher outside environment.  
-  Mist systems - These involve a series of mist -producing  
sprinklers which spray the cuttings or seed at controlled  
intervals. They serve to prevent drying out and to keep  
the propagating plants cool  in the leaf zone.  
-  Fogging systems - Fog systems are used as an alternative to  
the more traditional method of intermittent misting to  
provide cuttings with a humid environment. The  advantage of a fog system is that it still creates the humid  
environ ment, which is necessary to prevent the cuttings  
from drying out, but eliminates the water droplets that sit  
on the leaves in mist systems. The absence of free water  
from the leaves results in reduced fungal problems,  
reduced leaching of leaf nutrients  and improved aeration  
of the propagation media.  
-  Fluorescent light boxes - Plants of many species  
propagate well under artificial light. The cool white  
fluorescent tubes are preferable.  
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS  
Greenhouses are used to control the env ironment in which plants  
grow. The environment is extremely complex though, and  
there are many interactions between the various factors. For  
example, the amount of light (solar radiation) entering the  
greenhouse might affect the air temperature, or if you close the  
vents or doors of a greenhouse, you may stop the temperature  
from dropping, but may be changing the balance of gases in the  
air. Every time one factor is altered, a number of other  
factors are also affected.  
Greenhouse management involves giving careful consideration to  
the full implications of every action you take.  
 
The Environment and Plant Growth  
The environmental factors that influence the growth of  
plants inside the greenhouse are:  
-  Atmospheric tempe rature -  the air.  -  Root zone temperature -  in the soil or hydroponic media the  
plants are growing in.  
-  Water temperature -  the water used to irrigate plants.  
-  Light conditions -  shaded, full light, dark.  
-  Atmospheric gases -  plants give off o xygen but take in carbon  
dioxide during photosynthesis. Plants will take in some  
oxygen during respiration (converting stored foods such as  
glucose into energy) and release some carbon -dioxide, but in  
an enclosed environment the amount of carbon -dioxid e in the  
atmosphere will soon diminish.  
-  Air movement -  mixes gases, and evens out temperatures.  
-  Atmospheric moisture -  humidity.  
-  Root zone moisture -  water levels in the soil or media.  
Temperature Control  
Greenhouse temperatures can be control led in several ways:  
-  The sun will warm the greenhouse during the day. This effect  
varies according to the time of year, time of day and the  
weather conditions that day. The way the greenhouse is built  
and the materials used in construction will also influence the  
house - s ability to catch heat from the sun, and hold that heat.  
-  Heaters can be used to add to the heat in a house. The heater  
must have the ability to replace heat at the same rate at which  
it is being lost to the outside, so that desired temperatures can  
be maintained.  
-  Vents and doors can be opened to let cool air into the  
greenhouse, or closed to stop warm air from escapi ng. 
-  Shade cloth can be drawn over the house to reduce the  
amount of sunlight energy being transmitted into the  
greenhouse. (Greenhouse paints such as whitewash can be  applied in spring for the same effect. The type of paint used is  
normally one whic h will last the summer, but wash off with  
weathering to allow penetration of warming light in winter).  
-  Coolers (blowers etc) can be used to lower temperature.  
-  Watering or misting systems can be used to lower  
temperature.  
-  Exhaust fans can be used  to lower temperature.  
-  Water storage, or rock beds, under the floor or benches  
of a glasshouse can act as a buffer to temperature  
fluctuations.  
-  Hot beds used to heat root zone areas will also help heat  
the 
 
 
greenhouse in general.  
-  Thermal blank ets can be drawn across the top of  
greenhouses at night, usually by means of a small hand - 
operated winch to trap heat gained during the day.  
Heat loss  
An important consideration in temperature control is the  
heat lost through the walls and the roof of t he house.  
Different types of materials (eg. glass, plastic etc) have  
differing levels of ability to retain heat. Heat is normally  
measured in BTUs (British Thermal Units). The table below  
provides some insight into the respective qualities of  
different materials.

Heating systems  
There are two main types of heating systems:  
1. Centralised heating system  
This is normally a boiler or boilers in one location  
generating steam or hot water which is piped to one or  
more greenhouse complexes. This is usually the most  
expensive to install and may be more expensive to  
operate. There are side benefits though (e g. steam  
which is generated can be used to sterilise soil, pots  
etc). This type of system is only appropriate in large  
nurseries or hydroponic setups.  2. Localised heating systems  
This uses several individual heaters, normally  
blowing hot air into the greenhouse. Hot air is often  
distributed through a plastic tube (or sleeve), 30 -60  
cm diameter which is hung from the roof and has  
holes cut at calculated intervals for distribution of  
warm air.  
 
 
The main types of localised heaters are:  
Unit Heaters  
These consist of three parts:  
1. Fuel is burnt in the firebox to provide heat at the bottom of  
the unit (the fuel could be gas, oil or something else).  
2. Heat rises through a set of thin -walled metal tubes or pipes,  
which heat up.  
3. Behind the heated tu bes is a fan which blows cold air  
through the pipes out the other side into the house.  
Convection heaters  
These are cheap to purchase and consequently are frequently  
used by hobbyists and small commercial growers. They differ  
from unit heaters in that they do not have a built -in heat  
exchanger. Fuel of almost any type can be combusted in the  
firebox (eg. wood, coal, gas, oil). Hot fumes then pass out of an  
exhaust pipe which can be placed between rows of plants, above  
the h eater, or wherever desired. The exhaust pipe should be  
sufficiently long (or outlets placed far enough away from plants),  
to ensure dangerously hot air does not come in contact with the  
plants.  A metal stovepipe or insulated ducting is ideal, however  
polythene tubing can be used as well. A pot belly stove or  
something similar could be used as a convection heater.  
Note that when fuel is used for heating, it is important that  
sufficient oxygen is available in the greenhouse and that  
complete combustion  occurs, as a side effect of incomplete  
combustion is the gas ethylene which can cause major crop  
damage if it contaminates the greenhouse environment.  
Electric heaters  
In some areas electricity is cheap. If you happen to have cheap  
electricity, an elec tric heater may be considered. These generally  
consist of a heating element and a fan which blows air across the  
heating element and into the glasshouse.  
Radiant heaters  
Low energy, infrared radiant heaters have become popular in  
the US in recent years.  Growers report significant savings on  
fuel costs.  
Solar heaters  
There are several different types of solar heaters which can  
be used or adapted for use in greenhouse heating. The  
components of a solar heater are:  
1. A collector. These are usually panels heated by direct  
sunlight. The front is transparent to allow light in, the back is  
black and insulated to stop energy escaping. Light is  
converted to heat when it is absorbed by the dark surface.  
2. A heat store.  Water and rocks are two of the most common  
stores. Water can be passed through the collector and  
returned to a storage tank of water. Air can pass through the  
collector and return to the storage tank of rocks.  3. A heat exchanger. Pipes or tubes can pa ss through the  
heat store and out through the greenhouse and back to  
complete the cycle. A heat exchange f luid, or perhaps air  
can f low through  
 
 
these pipes.  
A backup heater may be needed to be used in conjunction  
with a solar system.  
 
Light Control  
Shading  
Natural light levels in some greenhouses may at some times  
of the year become too great for some plants. Excessive  
sunlight can also cause problems by heating the greenhouse  
too much. The need to provide shading will depend on:  
-  Construction - materials Fibreglass, for instance, does not  
allow as much light into the greenhouse as glass does.  
-  Location - Greenhouses in warmer climates more  
frequently need shading.  
-  Aspect - In the Southern Hemisphere, greenhouses on a  
north slope running on an east -west line will catch more  
sun than houses on a south slope running on a north - 
south line. The opposite applies in the Northern  
Hemisphere.  
-  Time of year - Shading becomes more critical in summer  
than in winter.  
-  Type of plants - Some plants need more shading than others.  
Shading includes using shadecloth attached to the outside of  the greenhouse or roll -down blinds. If the blinds are  
fitted on the outside the temperature inside is reduced,  
however, usually the venti lators cannot be opened. If the  
blinds are fitted on the inside the internal temperature is  
not reduced, but the light intensity is. Blinds can be  
automated to open and close on preset temperatures.  
Another method is using double sheets suspended from  
the internal roof trusses lengthways. These mechanically  
controlled systems roll the double layers into very small  
diameter rolls that minimise the loss of light. The upper  
layer is a white polyester fabric that reduces light by 45%  
while the lower pol yethylene level permits 90% of the light  
to pass to the crop.  
A less commonly used method is to apply a shading paint  
called Lightening Crystals, which can be sprayed on the  
roof. However it is not removable, limiting its practical  
use in many situatio ns. 
Paint -based shading compounds  
Paint -based preparations are ideal for semi -permanent  
shading requirements. They are applied with a brush,  
roller or spray gun to various densities, according to  
shading requirements of the species grown. There a  
number of preparations available that can be applied in  
spring when light intensifies, directly to the outside of the  
greenhouse. Light -coloured acrylic -based paints have a long - 
lasting effect.  
A Belgi an product, Parasoline, now available in a number of  
countries, overcomes the problem of too much shading at  
times of low light. This product has the ability to change  from a white light reflecting layer during sunny conditions,  
to translucent in rainy  conditions, allowing light penetration.  
Supplementary Lighting  
Greenhouse structures frequently use lighting to assist  
growth by supplementing natural light. Plants will respond  
to the artificial lights as all lamps radiate different  
qualities of the l ight spectrum.  
 
 
Lamps used in greenhouses are normally one of the following:  
1. Incandescent - (tungsten filament) These are generally  
not ideal in nurseries. Among other things the quality  
of light is poor and they create excessive heat. They have a  
high proportion of red light and this can facilitate fast stalk  
growth and blooms at the expense of longevity.  
2. Fluorescent - (eg. Gro -Lux f luorescent lamps) Fluorescent  
lamps have been useful in propagation areas and with young  
plants, but are not su itable for plants in the latter stages of  
production. They increase f lowering for a longer  
duration.  
3. High intensity discharge - (eg. high pressure mercury or  
metal halide) These are the best for plants in the latter stages  
of production, prior to selling and to promote stem  
thickness.  
 
Humidity  
Humidity can be increased in the growing environment in the  
following ways:  
-  Using equipment such as humidifiers or fogging machines.  -  Periodically spraying a fine mist for a short period through a  
fine sprinkler head.  
-  Using moist mulch around the plants (eg. woodshavings are  
sometimes laid on the greenhouse floor and kept wet to raise  
humidity.  
Ventilation S ystems  
Use of vents and fans to control both temperature and the  
balance of gases in the greenhouse environment is a very  
important aspect of the management of any greenhouse.  
Ventilation is required to remove used air and maintain air  
circulation. Thi s constant circulation reduces the likelihood of  
a fungal disease outbreak.  
Cooling equipment ranges from manually operated vents and  
shadecloth coverings in simple setups, to fully -automated cooling  
fans and ventilators in large commercial ventures. In  very large  
houses, the use of forced air fans becomes more necessary.  
Cool air is introduced by evaporative cooling, where fresh air is  
cooled and pumped into the greenhouse and the hot air is  
sucked to one end and dispelled. Air passed through fans c an be  
heated or cooled for additional temperature control. By  
connecting fans to an electronic thermostat it is possible to have  
them switch on and off automatically as and when ventilation is  
needed for temperature control.  
Placement of the pad and fans of the evaporative cooling  
system is important. The most versatile placement of the pad  
is inside the greenhouse wall, allowing  ventilators in that wall to  
open and close to adjust to weather conditions. Exhaust fans  
should be at least 5 m apart from the pad, to prevent warm,  
moist air moving towards an intake pad. When greenhouse  walls are less than 4.6 m apart, fans in adjac ent walls should be  
alternated so they do not expel air toward each other.  
Plants inside a greenhouse should be kept as far away as possible  
from vents or fan outlets (temperature variations can be more  
extreme in these positions).  
Greenhouses require a  vent area that is at least 30% of  
the f loor space area to allow for sufficient air exchanges per  
hour, temperature control and gas exchange. Greenhouses in  
tropical  
 
 
climates are advised to have greater than 30% as vent area.  
 
 
COMPUTERISED  
ENVIRONM ENTAL CONTROL  
Computers are capable of delivering a 15 to 25% saving in  
costs, and reduce labour considerably in the greenhouse.  
Computer - controlled equipment that manages the greenhouse  
environment is widely available. Such equipment can control  
temp erature, humidity, light intensity, application of black cloth  
shade, light reduction as needed, ventilation fans and  
irrigation.  
Computer -controlled environments can control the  
temperature to within one -tenth of a degree where manual  
control is at best within 2 -3 Degrees. They also do the job  
gradually, which puts less load on the equipment as compared to  
the abrupt changes resulting from manual operation. Computer  
controls w ork 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When used  correctly, they continuously deliver the most cost -efficient  
control of heating/ventilating systems.  
Intelligent Environmental Controllers  
The most recent types of computer -controlled equipment are  
known as - intelligent environmental controllers - . These  
systems are capable of sensing, adjusting and recording all  
aspects of the greenhouse environment, including temperature,  
light intensity, carbon dioxide concentrations and humidity.  
Sensors are strategica lly placed within the greenhouse and  
linked to external computers which are programmed to  
activate an optimal balance of growing conditions. The  
measurements and adjustments are made to maintain growth at  
the fullest potential, without unnecessary expe nditure of energy.  
The adjustments are recorded so that the grower can ensure  
growing conditions are maintained at optimum levels.  
Furthermore, the new computer control systems are manually  
programmed, which allows the grower to alter growing  
paramete rs to accommodate a new crop or incorporate new  
information.  
It is possible for computers to control the f low of nutrients to  
large hydroponic systems in a greenhouse. This means that  
settings can be very specific and controlled without the need for  
regular human intervention. Obviously such systems require a  
large capital outlay and are suitable only for large commercial  
ventures.  
 
 
PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL  
Pests and diseases can be  more of a problem in a greenhouse  than out in the field. On the one hand, the greenhouse  
is contained, which means it can be protected from infection  
(providing you practice cleanliness). Unfortunately,  
though, once you do get a pest or disease into a   
greenhouse, it tends to spread throughout the whole house  
very quickly (partly because the plants are growing so  
close together, partly because the warmth and humidity of  
the greenhouse tend to provide ideal conditions for pest and  
disease problems).  
Fungal problems in particular are of great concern in the  
greenhouse. Proper attention to environmental  
factors such as temperature and humidity go a long way  
toward preventing fungal problems. Regular checks and  
intervention will reduce the likelihoo d of fungal outbreaks  
spreading in the greenhouse.

 CHAPTER 11 : PLANT CULTURE IN HYDROPONICS   
 
 
 
This chapter deals with some of the specific  
horticultural techniques used to maximise  
cropping in hydroponics.  
PLANT SUPPORT  
Plants grown in hydroponics tend to be more prone to  
falling over than plants grown in soil; and thus frequently  
need some type of trellis support. Water culture methods such as  
NFT and lightweight materials such as perlite, vermiculite and  
rock wool do not provide firm anchorage of roots in the way  that soil does.  
-  Tall growing plants in particular need support.  
-  Stronger supports are needed if plants are exposed to wind.  
-  A greater bulk of plant will need a stronger  
trellis. There are two types of trellis systems:  
1. Horizontal trellis  
Here a mes h of wire, nylon or some other material is  
supported above the plants in one or two layers (depending  
on the height of the plants and the amount of support  
needed).  
Carnations, capsicums, and other small bushy plants  
require this type of trellis.  
2. Vertical trellis  
This may consist of a similar mesh material stretched along a  
row, or alternatively, single wires stretched along a row with  
support posts at each end. Vertical trellis can also be  
hung from the ceiling in a greenhouse.  
-  Tomatoes can be  grown on wires tensioned and spaced at 50  
cm intervals. The stems are tied to the wires as they grow.  
-  Cucumbers require greater support and are either grown  
on a vertical mesh, or on wires at 15 to 20 cm spacing. The  
wires should be tied together every 20 to 30 cm to form a  
mesh and give additional support.  
-  In large systems wires need to be connected to turnbuckles so  
they can be tensioned if they loosen.  
 
 
PRUNING  
Plants are pruned for one of the following reason s: 1. To remove dead or diseased vegetation  
This is done so that disease does not spread. Any dead or  
diseased stems, leaves, fruit or f lowers should be cut  
cleanly from plants and disposed of as soon as it is  
noticed, irrespective of the crop.  
2. To rejuvenate a plant  
Young lush growth is always healthier than tired old  
wood. A rose for instance can have its life extended and  
health improved, if old wood is continually removed  
over a period of years, and replaced by younger wood.  
3. To control the d irection or shape of growth  
A plant can be made bushier by removing the  
terminal bud of a shoot or stem. When the tip is cut or  
pinched out, side shoots are forced to develop so that  
several shoots occur where before there was only one. If  
you want a t aller, less bushy plant, side shoots are  
removed so that there are fewer growing points (e.g. this  
is done with tomatoes until they establish and begin f  
lowering).  
4. To control the type of growth  
Some plants produce f lowers and fruit on growth  
which is in its first year. Other plants produce f  
lower buds only on older wood (e.g. two -year -old  
wood). By knowing the type of wood that f lowers occur  
on, it is possible to prune in order to maximise the fruit  
or f lower crop. By removing all f low er buds, it may be  
possible to redirect a plan - s energies into vegetative  
growth.  
 Pruning Examples  
Raspberries  
Raspberries produce fruit on two -year -old wood. These should  
be pruned each winter as follows:  
-  Remove wood which produced fruit last seas on (because  
this will be 3 years old next season and won - t fruit much  
at all then).  
-  Leave the strongest growth of one -year -old wood  
(because those will be 2 years old and will produce fruit  
next season).  
-  Leave the strongest half of the new growt h which  
emerged over the past season (i.e. one -year -old wood),  
because those growths will produce fruit the season after  
next.  
 
 
Chrysanthemums  
Chrysanthemums produce f lowers on the tips of young  
growth. The more tips a bush has, the greater the numbe r of f  
lowers it will have, but the smaller each f lower will be.  
-  If you require a large quantity of flowers, you will remove the  
terminal bud when you plant a young plant, and periodically  
pinch out the growing points in the developing stages of the  
plant. You must cease removing the growing points when  
flowers start to develop though, or you will be removing  
flower buds.  
-  If you require fewer flowers, but larger and of better qualify,  
you should cease pinching our terminal buds much earlier.  
 POLLINATION  
Some plants can have problems with pollination, which  
result in a reduced number of fruit. Corn, strawberries, tomatoes  
and cucumbers may be affected in this way, particularly if grown  
in a greenhouse which has reduced air movement and limited  
access to pollinating insects. The following methods may be used  
to help pollination in these and other problem situations:  
-  Fans to increase air movement  
-  Vibrating the flowers by tapping them with a stick of shaking  
them with your hand (not too hard though or you will  
damage the plants).  
-  Releasing bees into the greenhouse.  
-  Moving pollen physically from plant to plant wi th cotton wool  
or some similar material.  
-  Reducing humidity (which can cause pollen to stick on the  
plant it comes from and not move to where it is needed).  
If you are planning to do any of these things, they must be  
done at the appropriate time, when  the plant is receptive (e.g.  
tomato pollination should be done in later morning, under  
sunny conditions when the petals of the f lowers are curling  
back).  
 
 
CARBON DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT  
Plants need carbon dioxide in the same way that humans  
need oxygen. Without a good supply of carbon dioxide  
growth will slow.  
In some crops and in some localities, yields can be  
significantly increased by increasing the level of carbon  dioxide in the g rowing environment. This is of course most  
suited to a sealed greenhouse. In an enclosed environment  
such as a greenhouse, there is a real danger of plants  
becoming starved for carbon dioxide. If vents to the  
outside are closed, the plants will in thei r normal course of  
growth gradually deplete carbon dioxide until they reach a  
level where growth is slowed.  
The optimum level for most crops will be around 1000  
to 1400 ppm (although natural levels are only around  
300ppm). Nutrition and water demand ma y increase  
when carbon dioxide is used.  
Methods of supplying carbon dioxide are:  
-  At the same time heating a greenhouse: burn a  
hydrocarbon fuel such as kerosene or propane.  
-  Place containers of dry ice in the greenhouse.  
-  Release gas from pressuri sed cylinders.  
Carbon dioxide enrichment can benefit the crops below as follows:  
-  Commercial tomato growers in northern parts of the USA  
claim crop increases of 20 to 30%.  
-  Lettuce and cucumber yields increase up to 30% in cool climates.  
-  Carnations  crop faster, have stronger stems and will give  
production increases of up to 30%.  
-  Roses under 1000 ppm carbon dioxide levels over winter  
in cool climates have increased production, improved  
quality and shorter cropping times.  
-  Chrysanthemums have stronger and longer stems and crop faster.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
TRANSPLANTING  
Whenever you transplant a seedling into hydroponics there  
will be some - shock -  effect which is detrimental to the plant and  
will result in either:  
-  Some dieback on the root system -  some of the root hairs and  
perhaps root tips may die; or  
-  A break in the growth -  growth will slow or cease for a period.  
This shock effect will normally be unnoticeable with  
hardy and easy to grow plant varieties, but can be significant in  
some situations.  
Transplant shock can be minimised by following these rules:  
-  Don- t disturb roots any more than is necessary.  
-  Use young plants growing in hydroponic media such as  
Growool where possible, so that the propagating medium can  
be retained and most of the roots do not have to be exposed.  
-  Roots should be exposed to the air for the absolute  
minimum amount of time  
-  Don- t transplant in hot, windy or dry conditions.  
-  If planting into NFT, have the system running before you  
start transplanting.  
-  If planting into aggregate, apply nutrient solution  before transplanting.  
-  If planting onto rockwool slabs, soak the slabs with  
nutrient solution before transplanting.  
-  If you damage or prune the roots of a transplant, cut a  
corresponding amount of the top back before transplanting.  
-  Plants which are more susceptible to transplant shock can be  
sprayed with a mist of water (not nutrient solution!) just  
before transp lanting.  
-  Irrigate plants immediately after transplanting.  
MANAGING PLANT HEALTH  
Diagnosis of Problems  
Problems fall into three possible categories:  
1. Nutritional -  either too little or too much of one or  
several particular nutrients is available.  
2. Environmental -  The environmental conditions are not  
suitable.  
3. Pathological -  One or more organisms are interfering with  
the health of the plant. Such organisms are called  
- pathogens - . 
It requires a great deal of knowledge and expertise to be abl e to  
diagnose plant troubles. Do not expect to develop such ability  
quickly. The first and perhaps most important skill to  
develop is an ability to inspect a plant and look for the tell -tale  
symptoms which can provide an indication of what might  
be wrong.  
 
 
The table at the top of the next page provides a  
systematic approach to inspecting plants which you  suspect (or know)  might be unhealthy. You should look at  
each of the - items -  one at a time, following the guide given  
by the - method of inspection -  column.  
 
Tell-tale Symptoms  
1. Wilting  
-  Insufficient water in the soil.  
-  Leaves drying out faster than the water ca n be taken up (too hot).  
-  Something stopping water going up the stem (e.g. borer,  
disease, etc in lower part of plant). Take a close look!  
2. Yellow Leaves  
If older leaves:  
-  Lack of nitrogen (feed with a nitrogen fertiliser)  
-  Lack of nitrogen caused  by wet soil -  wet soil stops  
nitrogen being taken into the plant (improve drainage or  
reduce watering).  
-  Chemical damage.  
-  Soil very dry.  
If younger leaves:  
-  Iron deficiency.  
-  Other nutrient deficiency.  
-  Chemical damage.  
3. Distribution of damage  
Look to see if the damage is evenly distributed over  
the plant. Is there a pattern:  
-  On one side only -  
-  On the top only -  
-  One the most exposed parts -  
4. Duration of damage  Look to see whether the damage has only just  
happened or it has happened in the past.  
-  The appearance of the growing tips tells you the current condition.  
-  Young shoots indicate a healthy plant overcoming past problems.  
-  Excessive side shoots lower down indicate disruption of  
hormone flow in the  plant.

(bushy fo r shrub, strong terminal growth for tree,  etc); growth rate.  
Soil 
Feel surface of soil, push finger 2 -4 cm below  
surface. Remove plant from pot  
Moisture/dryness; hardness, root density;  
burrows; wet/dry spots.

PESTS  
The term plant pests can include a wide range of organisms  
including:  -  Insects which feed on plants or which transmit other  
problems such as fungal and viral diseases from plant to  
plant.  
-  Animals which cause physical damage by digging around  
plant s, knocking plants or eating plants (e.g. goats, birds and  
dogs).  
-  Animals causing burn to plant tissue by urinating on them  
(e.g. dogs).  
-  Man causing physical harm to plants by compacting soil  
through over -use, knocking and damaging plant tissue,  
transmitting diseases to the vicinity of - clean -  plants, and  
through other forms of mismanagement.  
-  Snails, slugs, nematodes, yabbies, wood lice, mites and other  
small animals feeding on plants, transmitting diseases, etc.  
Feeding habits  
The followin g may assist in quick identification of insects  
and other pets causing damage to a plant. They are grouped  
below according to the type of pant damage which they cause.  
The list is not exhaustive, but it should cover most common  
types you will encounter . 
-  Insects and other pests which chew above the ground:  
armyworm, bees, bugs, beetles, caterpillars, crickets,  
cutworm, earwig, grasshopper, leafminers, leafrollers, leaf  
skeletonisers, sawflies, slugs, snails, springtails and weevils.  
-  Insects and other pests which feed below the ground: root  
aphis, root nematodes, root borer, rootworm, root weevil,  
woolly aphis, wireworm, beetle larvae  
-  Borers: codling moth, bark be etle, corn, earworm, white pine  
weevil, melon worm, longicorn weevil, European apple sawfly,  etc. 
Common Pests and Their Control in  
Hydroponic Culture  
Aphis  
These are small insects which cluster in large numbers on tender  
growth (typically on tips of g rowing shoots, flower buds and  
occasionally roots). They can usually be controlled with an  
organic pyrethrum spray. Malathion will give good control, but  
should not be used on food crops close to harvest.  
Birds  
Birds will attach and eat fruits from many  plants including  
tomatoes and strawberries. Greenhouse crops are protected by  
the greenhouse cover. Bird netting is an effective control, but it  
can be very expensive. Regular picking of near ripe fruit will  
minimise the problem.  
Cabbage White Butterf ly 
This is the caterpillar of a white butterfly. See caterpillar  
(below).  
Caterpillars  
Caterpillars are chewing grubs which eat foliage and sometimes  
other plant parts. Control safely with a spray of Dipel -  (this is a  
bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, which attacks and kills  
caterpillars, but has no effect on any other type of insect or  
animal). Malathion or Carbaryl  
 
 
will give good control, but shouldn - t be used on food crops  
close to harvest.  
Crickets  Crickets are not a frequent problem, but can occasionally  
occur in large numbers and eat anything in sight. Malathion  
is an effective control.  
Grubs  
Grubs are the larvae of many different types of insects  
which burrow inside fruits, stems or other plant  parts.  
As they are on the inside of the plant, most insecticides  
will not kill them. These can only be controlled by either  
removing and burning the infected parts, or treating with a  
systemic insecticide such as rogor (Dimethoate).  
Leafhoppers  
These are tiny insects feeding on the lower surface of  
leaves causing major mottling or f lecks on foliage. These  
can be treated by spraying with Carbaryl or Malathion.  
Leafminers  
Leafminers are insects whose grubs burrow tunnels through  
the leaves. Tunnels a ppear white or clear at first. These  
can be treated by spraying with Diazinon or Malathion.  
Mealy Bug  
This is a small f luffy scale -like insect (with a cotton wool - 
like covering). It is a sucking insect related to scale and  
aphis. It occurs in moist org anic material (such as wood or  
peat moss), and occurs on protected underside of leaves in  
humid or moist, warm conditions. Mealy bug can be  
controlled with Malathion. Regular sprays of pyrethrum  
give a lower toxicity control, although it is not as  
thorough.  
Mites  
These are tiny spiders, virtually impossible to see with  the naked eye, though in large numbers they can cause a  
haze of red colour. Mites can attack foliage, fruit and other  
plant pa rts on many different crop plants. They occur in  
hot, moist conditions. Mites can be controlled safely by  
releasing parasitic mites which feed on the plant pests. To  
control, spray with malathion, dimethoate, or difocol.  
Scale  
Scale are shield -like inse cts which attach themselves to  
the surface of stems, fruits and leaves. Scale can be  
controlled by smothering with a spray of white oil.  
Thrip  
Small f lying insects which suck plant sap causing f  
lecking on f lowers or foliage of many different types of   
plants. For control, spray with pyrethrum, rogor or  
malathion.  
 
 
Whitefly  
These are small white, f lying insects which move in great  
numbers when disturbed. Whitefly can be controlled with  
malathion.  
 
PLANT DISEASES IN HYDROPONIC  
CULTURE  
Plant disease is generally distinguished from insect and other  
pest problems. Plant pests actually eat the plant, or break the  
plant by standing on it (as does the human pest). Plant disease is  
far more subtle, disturbing the microscopic physiological  
processes within the plant.  When a plant is diseased, it may be affected by one, two or more  
different problems. It is often difficult to identify what is  
wrong with a plant clearly, because the problem is in fact a  
combination of problems.  
A possible s cenario is outlined in the example below:  
-  The plant is weakened by poor nutrition.  
-  Excessively wet conditions create an environment conducive  
to the growth of an infectious fungus.  
-  The plant, weakened by poor nutrition, is infected by the  
fungal  diseases that develop in wet conditions.  
-  The roots begin to rot through fungal attack.  
-  Because the roots are damaged, the plant does not take in  
water and nutrients as well as it would normally.  
-  The leaves of the plant are infected by a second d isease  
because of the above situation, which has made the plant  
weak and less able to repel infection.  
-  Disease organisms reproduce spreading infection much wider  
 
 
Disease organisms usually fall into one of  
the following groups:  
Viruses  
Viruses are v ery small microscopic particles composed of  
nucleic acid and protein. They exhibit many, but not all,  
characteristics of living organisms, and are therefore  
sometimes called a life form. Viruses can mutate. They cause  
many serious diseases, frequently causing variegation or  
mottling of leaf colour. Some viruses are considered  
beneficial because of the variations they provide in leaf  colour. Whether conside red beneficial or not, viruses  
cause a general weakening of plants they infect, making the  
plant more susceptible to other problems, and frequently  
stunting growth to some degree.  
Bacteria  
These are single -celled organisms, some of the smallest  
living things. They enter plants through stomata or  
wounds. (They cannot break directly through cell walls or  
the - surface -  of a plant). Bacteria can cause rots, blights,  
spots, galls, scabs and other symptoms. (N.B. Fungi can  
also cause many of these.)  
Fungi 
Fungi are chlorophyll -less members of the Thalophyte  
plants. They are either parasites (living on live tissue) or  
saprophytes (living on dead tissue). Over 15 000 species  
are known, and many are responsible for major plant  
diseases. Fungi are thread -like organisms which grow  
amongst the tissue from which they derive their nutrition.  
The individual threads are known as mycelium. To  
reproduce, fungi grow fruiting bodies from a mass of  
mycelium, and spores are produced in these fruiting  
bodies.  
Nem atodes  
These are microscopic worms which feed in the  
intercellular spaces, causing breakdown of cell walls. They  
generally enter plants through the roots, through wounds or  
stomata (different nematodes have different standard  
methods of entry). Nematodes are much less of a problem in  
hydroponics than in soil.  Common Terms Used to Describe Diseases  
-  Rot: Decomposition or decay of dead tissue.  
-  Spot: Well defined grey or brown tissues surrounded by  
purplish margins (or margins of some other dark colour).  
-  Shot hole: Dead tissue in a spot cracks and falls, leaving a  
hole in the leaf.  
-  Blotch: Fungal growth appearing on the surface of a dead spot.  
-  Blight: Quick deat h of complete parts of a plant. The  
disease pathogen develops very quickly, e.g. leaves die  
and fall.  
-  Wilting: Drooping of leaves and/or stems.  
 
 
-  Scorch: Similar to blight but leaf veins are not affected. Leaf  
tissue dies between the veins, or alo ng the margins.  
-  Scald: Whitening of surface (or near surface) cell layer on  
fruit or leaves.  
-  Blast: Unopened buds or flowers die suddenly.  
-  Die back: Death of growing tips, moving down through the  
plant (i.e. the terminal buds dies, followed by d eath of the  
stems and lower parts of the plant). Die back can occur to just  
part of the plant or, in severe cases, can continue moving  
through the plant to the roots.  
-  Damping off: Sudden wilting and falling over of young plants  
due to tissue being attacked by fungal disease near the soil  
line.  
-  Mummification: Diseased fruit dries up, becoming wrinkled  
and hardening as it shrinks.  
-  Canker: Death of a restricted  area of woody tissue, usually a  callus of healthy growth forms around the edge of the canker.  
-  Bleeding: A substance is exuded from a diseased part of the  
wood. Only refers to exudation which is not resinous or  
gummy.  
-  Gummosis: Bleeding where the exudation is resinous or  
gummy. Gummosis on conifers is called resinosis.  
-  Firing: Leaves suddenly dry, collapse and die.  
-  Rosettin: Spaces between leaves on step do not develop: buds  
and leaves become squashed together within a short section  
of ste m. 
-  Mosaic: Mottling of yellow and green on leaf surface.  
-  Dwarfing: Plants do not grow to full size.  
-  Fasciation: Round plant parts such as stems become  
distorted, broadened and flattened.  
 
PHYSIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS  
There are a number of environmental  factors which can damage  
a crop if not properly controlled. Frost or sun may burn fruits or  
foliage, fruit can crack and leaves can discolour. Some of the more  
common problems are detailed below.  
 
Cracking  
Lack of water or excess water can cause the sk in of various  
crops to split. Freshly harvested carrots sometimes split.  
Tomatoes that are suffering from lack of water and exposed to  
high temperatures may split.  
Blossom end rot  
A common problem with tomatoes is where the bottom of the  
tomato turns brown or black and leathery in appearance. This  typically occurs where there a low supply of calcium combined  
with irregular growth, causing stress in the plant. Irregular and  
varia ble water supply and variable temperature conditions are  
also associated with this problem.  
 
Crooking  
This is where fruit becomes distorted (eg. when cucumbers  
become excessively curved). Crooking has been attributed to  
poor control of temperature, mois ture or nutrition.  
 
COMMON DISEASES AND THEIR  
 
 
CONTROL IN HYDROPONICS  
Alternaria  
This blight commonly affects leaves, sometimes stems.  
Symptoms are usually spots, often developing concentric  
rings as they enlarge. There are many types of alternaria.  
Most are controlled with Zineb. A copper spray will control  
some.  
 
Anthracnose  
There are two different groups of anthracnose diseases,  
distinguishable by their symptoms:  
1. Symptoms are dead spots.  
2. Symptoms are improper development of some part of  
the plant (e.g. a raised border around a depressed central  
area of undeveloped tissue.  
Anthracnose can be controlled by various fungicides.  Some types are controlled by copper sprays, others by Zineb  
and other chemicals.  
 
Botrytis  
A grey f luffy mouldy growth occurring on stems, leaves,  
f lowers and leaves, botrytis occurs in wet, humid  
conditions. Affected parts should be removed and burned  
immediately.  
Preventative measures include increasing air flow and  
reducing humidity. Thiram and dichlofluanid fungicides can  
be used to control infections.  
 
Downy mildew  
The upper leaf of a plant with this disease shows  
yellowing or dull patches with a greying mould growing  
underneath. It occurs under most c onditions, and is  
controlled with Zineb.  
 
Fusarium  
Symptoms can include foliage yellowing, stunted growth,  
wilt and leaves dropping. Hygiene will usually control  
fusarium.  
 
Phytophthora  
There are several forms of Phytophthora ranging from  
disease that the stem of young seedlings to others that  
impair the uptake of nutrients in very large plants.  
Symptoms are frequently dramatic and can cause sudden  
death of the plant.  Remove infected parts and sterilise infected areas.  
Fongarid will effectively control some types of phytophthora  
and slow the spread of others.  
 
Powdery mildew  
This disease occurs in warm, moist, humid conditions The  
main symptom is a white powdery growth on leaf  
surfaces. Sulphur sprays or dust will usually give control.  
 
Rhizoctinia  
Symptoms are brown or black dead spots or rot, normally on leaves  
 
 
or stems. This disease can be controlled with terraclor.  
 
Scab  
Patches of discoloration develop into spongy, blister -like  
scabs which can affect leaves, stems or underground parts.  
Remove or burn infected parts. Spray with dithane (Maneb).  
 
Smut  
Symptoms are black spots with cracks developing in the spots to  
reveal a sooty black powder. Control with Maneb.  
 
 
Verticillium wilt  
The disease infects a variety of crop plants. Symptoms may  
be as mild as slight paleness in foliage to drooping of leaves,  
stunted growth, browning between the veins of a leaf, and  death. Symptoms can be slow or reasonably fast to deve lop.  
Infected plants should be removed and burnt, and infected  
areas should be sterilised before replanting.  
 
Virus  
Symptoms can be any type of abnormal growth, such as  
discolouration of foliage, twisted or stunted growth etc.  
Once a plant has a viral disease, it is virtually impossible  
to eliminate it from that plant. Prevent spread by  
controlling sucking insects (in particular aphis). Some  
plants (e.g. strawberry) deteriorate with the virus over a  
period of years. Control in such instances involve s replacing  
plants every few years with verified virus -free stock.  
 
INTEGRATED PEST  
MANAGEMENT (IPM)  
The main ways of controlling pests and diseases are as follows:  
1. Sanitation  
2. Resistance plant varieties  
3. Biological control  
4. Soil drenches/dips  
5. Chemical controls  
Increasingly hydroponic growers are using a variety of  
controls -  chemical, cultural and biological -  to minimise  
crop damage. While chemicals have proven to be  
effective in controlling certain pests in the past, their  
sole use is no longer advocated due to concerns over  
chemical residues in food, environmental contamination,  
and the increasing resistance of many insects to chemical  pesticides.  
Integrated Pest  Management (IPM) avoids overuse of  
chemicals by creating a growing environment where  
there is a balance between sustainable environmental  
practices and profitable crop production.  
The successful implementation of an IPM program relies on  
monitoring cr op and pest populations. Sticky traps are  
often used for this purpose. Staff must be trained to  
distinguish and identify beneficial insects from pests.  
IPM practices include:  
-  Installing micro -screens on air intake vents in greenhouses.  
-  Using clean seeds.  
-  Eliminating vegetation around the greenhouse.  
-  Cleaning hands, etc., prior to handling material.  
-  Monitoring pest levels and acting before they become a problem.  
Beneficial insects available to greenhouse producers  
includes predatory mites, beetles, wasps and nematodes.  
 
 
FORMS OF APPLIED INSECT  
CONTROL  
The following steps should be followed:  
1. Detect the problem.  
2. Identify the insect involved.  
3. Find out about the biology of the insect.  
4. Consider how important it is to control the insect.  
5. Consider the alternative control methods.  
6. Select the most appropriate method and carry out what  
action is necessary.  7. Evaluate.  
 
Mechanical Control  
This involves using specific physical equipm ent or techniques  
such as insect screens, plant enclosures, metal shields (on  
building foundations), sticky banks in the path of insects  
etc. The key to mechanical control is to use the appropriate  
method at the appropriate time. Timing is very importa nt! 
Some specific examples of mechanical control include:  
-  Banking the legs of a bench with a sticky layer will prevent and  
trap insects crawling up onto the bench (e.g. ants)  
-  Draping young plants with a covering of cheesecloth will  
discourage cicad as 
-  Wrapping the trunk of a transplanted plant will prevent some  
types of borer attack  
-  Paper or plastic collars around a plant will discourage  
movement of cutworms  
-  Tree -wound paints can provide a barrier of wood borers and  
some types of ants.  
In some situations, irrigating an area heavily will kill off insect  
populations (perhaps f lood irrigation a system if the medium has  
become heavily infested).  
Raising or lowering temperatures can also be used to kill  
insects (e.g. in seed or grain, temperatures of over 140 degrees F  
may kill insects without damaging the seed). Usually, low  
temperatures will slow or stop insect activity, but without  
killing them as do high temperatures.  
Certain types of radiation (e. g. gamma rays or microwaves)  
may be used to control some types of insects (e.g. gamma  rays can make some insects sterile).  
 
Cultural Control  
Cultural control is a long term approach to managing insect  
populations. It is based on the concept that the bes t methods of  
growing plants will stop insect populations from developing  
in large numbers.  
Cleanliness is an important part of cultural control. This  
relies on removing infected plants or parts of plants as soon as  
they are found (e.g. infected fruit s hould be picked and burnt  
as soon as it is noticed).  
 
 
Crop rotation is another important cultural practice, even in  
hydroponics. The basis of crop rotations is to avoid growing  
consecutive crops in the same place if they share a pest or  
disease proble m. By following a crop of lettuce, for  
instance, with a crop of tomatoes, the pests which are a  
problem on lettuce (which may remain on your property  
after harvest) have nothing to grow on while the tomatoes  
grow. Hence the lettuce pests die out.  
 
Biological Control  
This involves manipulating biological factors to control  
insect populations. This includes:  
-  Using resistant varieties of plants bred or selected  
because of their ability to withstand pests.  
-  Using predators which attach or cause harm to the  
insects (e.g. Dipel is a commercially available spray of  bacteria which attacks and kills caterpillars. Some  
ladybirds attack and kill some scale).  
-  Manipulating the environment (i.e. destroying  
environments close to your crop where the pest or  
disease might breed, planting companion plants amongst  
your crop etc) with the aim of encouraging and  
discouraging certain insect species.  
Legislation  
Governments pass laws to restrict the movement of mate rial  
which tends to carry pests. Quarantine regulations  
provide for material to be kept in a separate area for a time  
and be inspected for pests before being released into the  
community. Other regulations can ban the import of  
certain materials or the  entry of unauthorised persons into  
certain areas.  
 
SUMMARY OF INSECTICIDES  
The most commonly used insecticides fall into one of the  
following groups  
-  Inorganic insecticides e.g. arsenic trioxide, boracic acid.  
These are generally persistent (they rem ain as a poison  
for many years, often hundreds of years). They vary a  
great deal in their toxicity to mammals. Some are very  
poisonous, others are not.  
-  Botanical insecticides, e.g. natural pyrethrins. Extracted  
from certain types of daisy plants (genus: Pyrethrum).  
These chemicals are generally not very toxic to  
mammals, and are not persistent (i.e. they break down to  
harmless compounds within a ve ry short period of time).  -  Organochlorine insecticides, e.g. aldrin, chlordane,  
dieldrin, heptachlor. Mammalian toxicities range form  
medium to very highly toxic, and the persistence is  
generally very long. These chemicals can remain active  
for hundr eds of years and are mostly illegal now.  
-  Organophosphate insecticides, e.g. chlorpyriphos,  
diazinon, dichlorvos, fenitrothion, fenthion, malathion  
(i.e. maldison), temephos, trichlorphon. Most are short to  
medium term in their persistence (lasting up  to a couple  
of months). Toxicities range from moderate to very high.  
-  Carbamate insecticides, e.g. bendiocarb, carbaryl,  
methomyl, propoxur. Persistence is short to medium  
term and toxicities are mainly moderate.  
 
 
-  Synthetic pyrethroids, e.g. perm ethrin, bioresmethrin,  
tetramethrin. Mammalian toxicities are generally low but  
persistence is some can be several months (but not years).  
-  Characteristics of Pesticides  
Consider the following before deciding on using a chemical. Your  
judgement of wha t to use should balance all of these factors with  
safety to yourself, your staff, your customers and the  
environment. The people from whom you buy chemicals should  
be able to show you documentation on these details.  
Toxicity  
This is a measure of the pesticide - s capacity to poison. This will,  
of course, vary from one organism to another -  it may be  
poisonous to one type of insect, but not to another. Toxicity to  
insects is not always directly related to toxicity to people,  domestic animals or wildlife.  
Spectrum of activity  
This is the range of organisms which it affects. Insecticides such  
as pyrethrins or dichlorvos are broad spectrum (i.e. they kill a  
wide ran ge of pests). Chemicals which kill only a small range  
of insects are called - narrow spectrum - . 
LD50  
LD50 is a measure of the toxicity to mammals. It is a measure of  
milligrams of poison per kilogram of body weight required  
to kill 50% of test animals.  It is generally tested on mice or rats  
to obtain the LD50 reading. Dermal LD50 is the result obtained  
by subjecting animals to a dose of the chemical through the  
skin. Oral LD50 is the result obtained by subjecting the  
animals to a dose of the chemica l through the mouth.  
Persistence  
Most pesticides will change form gradually after  
application. The effect of the chemical on organisms it contacts  
will therefore gradually be reduced. Persistence is a measure of  
how quickly or slowly the effectiveness o f the chemical  
declines. Persistence is rated in terms of - half life - . Half life is the  
length of time from application till the time when the chemical  
has half the effect it did when it was first applied. Dieldrin,  
for instance, has a half life of o ver 100 years, making it very  
persistent. Malathion has a half life measured in weeks. Some  
chemicals have a half life measured in hours.  
Volatility  
This is how easily the chemical becomes a gas. Volatile poisons  
are more dangerous to work with (e.g. dichlorvos), because they  
can readily be inhaled.  Repellency  
This is a chemical - s ability to repel insects from the place where it  
is applied. Pyrethr ins, for instance, repel insects such as  
mosquitoes and f lies.  
Flushing action  
This is the tendency of the chemicals to excite insects and make  
them leave places where they are hiding (e.g. making  
cockroaches leave cracks and crevices).  
Knockdown actio n 
 
 
This refers to the chemical - s ability to quickly  
incapacitate the insect, i.e. whether it kills quickly or not.  
Phytotoxicity  
This refers to the harmful effects the chemical might  
have on plants (e.g. some types of chemicals sprayed  
under certain c onditions will cause burning or other  
damage to plant foliage, growing tips etc).  
 
 
DISEASE CONTROL  
Diseases can be controlled in much the same way as insects,  
either by chemical pesticides, which have obvious drawbacks, or  
by non - chemical means such as changing environmental  
conditions or physically restricting the spread of disease.  
The following measures are commonly practiced to control  
diseases in hydroponic farms:  
-  Sterilise the system or greenhouse between crops t o  
eradicate disease spores. At the very least, wash with an  antiseptic solution, but beware of fumes.  
-  Keep tools and equipment clean. Always wash after use.  
Sterilise tools periodically by washing with an antiseptic  
solution.  
-  Make sure shoes and hands are washed clean before entering  
work areas.  
-  Be sure that your plants are not diseased (only purchase  
quality, preferably guaranteed healthy stock).  
-  Ensure good ventilation around plant leaves and stems.  
-  Don- t get leaves wet. It is better  to irrigate with drippers or  
sub- irrigations. Wet foliage is more susceptible to disease.  
-  Trim damaged or broken plant parts with a sharp knife or  
secateurs. Rough or torn tissue is more susceptible to disease  
attack.  
-  Remove any diseased or dead  plants or plant parts without  
hesitation. Often, you need to be ruthless to save the rest of  
your crop.  
 
THE LIFECYCLE OF A DISEASE  
Whatever method you use to control a disease, it is valuable to  
understand when and how it infects your crop, and what s tages it  
goes through before and after it is a problem to you.  
You may, for instance, be able to attack the disease and kill  
it before it even infects your crop, or you may be able to stop it  
from reaching your crop if you know where it comes from.  
Stages in Development of a Typical Fungal Disease  
1. Inoculation  
Inoculation occurs when the pathogen comes in contact  
with the pl ant. Any part of the pathogen which can attack  the plant is called the - inoculum - . 
If the inoculum lays dormant over winter and infects the  
plant in spring, this is called the primary inoculum, and it  
causes a primary infection. Inoculum produced from  this  
infection is called secondary inoculum and can cause  
secondary infection of the plant.  
Inoculum may be present in the soil or in dead plant material  
near to the plant being affected; or it may be brought into the  
area with seed, new plants, soil,  on the wheels of a car, on  
boots or shoes, or even carried on the wind. Inoculum  
can survive on weeds or infected plants nearby, and move  
onto cultivated plants when conditions are favourable.  
 
 
2. Penetration  
Pathogens move into plants by breaking thr ough the  
plant surface, or by entering through wounds or natural  
openings (such as stomata). Some fungi only  
penetrate trough one of these methods.  
Bacteria enter mainly through wounds. Viruses and  
microorganisms (microplasmas and some bacteria)  
enter  through wounds made by vectors. (A vector is  
a disease carrier; e.g. aphis carry viruses. They inject  
their mouthpiece into the plant, creating a wound, and  
place the virus inside). Nematodes normally enter  
through direct penetration.  
3. Infection  
This is the process by which the pathogen establishes  
contact with the cells or tissues that it is going to  infect. In this stage, the pathogen grows and invades  
parts of the plant.  
Changes to the plant can be either obvious or obscure at  
this point. You might see discolouration or necrosis as  
the disease moves through the plant or it may be that the  
changes are microscopic and necrosis or other  
symptoms are n ot seen until the next stage (growth and  
reproduction).  
4. Growth and reproduction  
The pathogen now grows and develops within the part of  
the plant which it inhabits. It then begins to  
reproduce itself.  
5. Dissemination  
Spores or organisms produced in t he growth and  
reproduction stage are moved to other places where they  
can sooner or later infect a new plant. Mostly, this  
dissemination is carried out by agents such as wind,  
water, insects, animals or man.  
 
 
WATER MANAGEMENT  
Water Requirements  
Plants  need both water and oxygen in their environment.  
The trick to successful plant growing is often to provide the  
proper delicate balance between these two. Too much air  
usually means too little water; and too much water usually  
means too little air. In aggregate culture, you should usually mix a  
well-draining medium (e.g. gravel) with a water -retaining  
medium (e.g. vermiculite) to gain the required balance of water  retention.  
In many fruits, water constitutes 90% of the total weight;  
for leaves, water content is 80%, and for seeds, 10%. Apart  
from its role in the composition of plant parts, water is also  
important for the movement of nutrients into the plant and  
of waste products out. Everything in a plant moves in a  
dissolved form. If water is not constantly replaced, the cells  
lose turgidity and the plant wilts.  
 
Water Excess  
Symptoms of excessive water are:  
-  Development of leggy seedlings. This usually happen s when  
the plants are too close together and the soil is warm and  
moist, as in glasshouses.  
-  Appearance of growth cracks (in tomato fruit, cabbage heads  
or carrots).  
-  Increased cell size.  
-  Long internodes (longer gaps between buds and stems).  
-  Bursting cells (seen under a microscope). This is usually  
caused by poor drainage or over -watering. Water excess can  
lead to stunting, die back of the top of the plant and, in  
extreme situations, death.  
There is a greater likelihood of infection with mou lds, rots  
and other fungal diseases in a wet situation.  
 
Water Deficiency  
Symptoms:  
-  The first symptom is that the growth rate reduces. Leaves  
become smaller (though still well -coloured).  -  Stems later become slender, flowers and fruit are smaller.  
-  On some watery fruits (e.g. tomatoes, lemons, peaches etc)  
the plant sometimes draws water from half -grown fruit,  
causing the fruit to shrivel.  
-  Die back from the leading shoots can occur , followed by death  
in extreme cases.  
A lack of water can be due to under -watering; a poor root  
system; excess drainage; or sometimes, extreme heat (i.e.  
water is sometimes evaporated out of the leaves faster than it can  
be absorbed through the roots i n hot and windy conditions).  
 
 
WATER RELATIONSHIPS  
Before designing for using an irrigation system it is  
necessary to have an understanding of the relationship  
between root environments, water and plants. The root  
environment comprises either:  
-  Solid material made up of particles of varied sizes and  
shapes which fit together imperfectly to form a complex  
systems of pores and channels; or  
-  An enclosed environment saturated with water in either  
a gaseous or liquid form (or both in the case of NFT).  
With a solid medium, when pore spaces are filled with water,  
the medium is saturated. This may occur after irrigation or  
rainfall. A medium will only remain saturated if excess water  
cannot drain freely. The amount of waster which a medium  
can hold at saturation depends on the volume of pore space  
available. This is known as the saturation capacity.  
Moisture in a solid medium can be classified into three types:  1. Gravity water -  This water can only remain in the  
medium for a short time before it drains out under  
gravity.  
2. Capillary water -  This is the main source of water for  
plant growth, occurring as a thin film on solid particles  
or as droplets in the pore space. It is hel d in place by  
surface tension. (When gravity has removed all the  
free water, a balance is reached where the surface  
tension binds all the remaining water, so that gravity  
is insufficient to remove it. This condition is known  
as field capacity).  
3. Hygroscopic water -  This is a thin film of water held  
so firmly to the solid particles that plants can - t  
remove it.  
Plants utilise water through a process known as  
transpiration. The plant acts as a pump, drawing water  
(against the forces holding it in the medium) into the  
plant roots, stems and leaves from where it is lost to the  
atmosphere via evaporation. (Evaporation occurs when  
moisture is sucked into the air, and is influenced by climactic  
features such a temperature, humidity and wind). If  
temperatures and evaporation rates are high, a plant will  
require more water from the medium than when they are  
low.  
Free water is readily utilised by plants; however,  
increasing suction is required to remove the water held by  
surface tension. When plants reach a stage where they can  
no longer draw enough water to provide for their needs,  
they may begin to droop. This is known as the wilting  point. If water becomes a vailable at this stage, the plant  
will recover; however, if it continues without water, it  
will reach a point where it is beyond recovery. This is  
known as the permanent wilting point. The difference  
between permanent wilting point and the soil moistur e  
content is known as the available water. The amount of  
water held and the amount that is tightly bound will vary  
from one medium to another.  
The table below indicates soil moisture quantities for some  
different soils expressed as percent by weight of  dry soil.  
This way of looking at a hydroponics medium is valuable  
when planning frequency and intensity of irrigations.  
Though the information might not be readily available for  
the medium you choose to use, it is worth making the effort  
to find out these details in the planning stages of a  
hydroponics venture.

When to Irrigate  
The zone between wilting point and field capacity is important in  
irrigation, with the aim being to keep moisture levels within this  
zone. It has been found generally that plants take most of their  requirements from the upper half of the root zone and as a  
consequence only about half of the available water is used.  
Irrigations is therefore generally required when this approximate  
half of the available water is used up. The amount of water to be  
applied to a crop is therefore half of the available water in the  
root zone of the crop when the medium is at field capaci ty. 
Irrigation applications are timed according to how quickly the  
plants use the available moisture and this is usually dependent  
on climatic conditions and the availability of nutrients. The rate  
at which water is supplied by irrigation is also import ant, and its  
governed by medium infiltration rates, i.e. the rate at which  
water will pass into the medium. If water is supplied at a rate  
greater than the medium can absorb it, runoff may occur and  
water may be wasted. The following table gives an ind ication of  
infiltration rates for some media.  
 
 
 
 
SOIL TYPE  
INFILTRATION RATE  
Coarse sand  
2500 mm/hr  
Find sand  
20-100 mm/hr  
Peat  
1-20 mm/hr  
The ideal situation is where application rates are equal  
to infiltration rates.  All plants need water to grow and survive. The amount of  
water needed, however, will vary from plant to plant. The  
two main factors that affect how much water a plant needs  
are: 
1. The variety of the plant  
Some types of plant have the ability to retain water  
within their tissues for later use. Other plants are  
unable to do this.  
2. The environment in which the plant is growing  
If there is plenty of water available around t he plant, it  
will tend to remain moister than in exposed, windy,  
sunny situations.  
A plant can suffer from a lack of water, but it can also  
suffer from an excessive amount of water. When you water a  
plant, it is important to strike that delicate balanc e between  
too little and too much. Over -watering can be just as bad  
as under -watering.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
MEASURING WATER AVAILABLE TO  
PLANTS IN A SOLID MEDIUM  
Calculating Field Capacity  
1. Wet the medium to near saturation. Cover to prevent drying  
from evaporation. Let it drain for 2 to 3 days.  
2. Take a sample of medium and weigh it.  
3. Place the sample in an oven at 105 degrees C to dry out.  
Weigh and record this second weight after drying. (Do not  
heat at a higher temperature as this can destroy organic  
material and give a false reading.)  
4. Calculate field capacity with the follo wing formula:  Field Capacity = Loss in weight x 100  
Final dry weight  
 
Calculating Permanent Wilting Point  
1. Fill a pot with the medium to be tested and plant a  
vegetable or f lower seedling into it.  
2. Grow the plant until its roots appear at the bottom  of the  
pot. 
3. Stop watering until wilting occurs. When the plant wilts,  
seal the surface of the pot with a sheet of plastic to prevent  
further loss of water through evaporation.  
4. Now place overnight in a humid enclosure (i.e. either a humid  
greenho use or plastic tent). If permanent wilting has not  
occurred, the plant will recover. If the wilting persists in the  
morning, you have then reached permanent wilting point.  
Weigh the medium after removing the plant and its  
roots.  
5. Now calculate moistu re content by drying the medium at 105  
degrees C to find the final dry medium mass.  
 
Available Moisture Range  
Available moisture range = Field capacity minus permanent  
wilting point.  
 
Estimating Water Requirements  
The amount of water required by a plant is affected by a number  
of factors including the following:  
Type of plant  
Some plant varieties use more water than others. Some plants  have a greater resistance to dry conditions (cacti and succulents  
are extreme examples).  
Rate of growth  
If a plant grows rapidly (perhaps because of its variety, or  
perhaps due to optimum growing conditions in terms of  
fertility, climate etc), it will use water at a faster rate.  
 
 
Climate  
In high temperatures soil loses water thro ugh  
evaporation. In windy conditions both soil and leaves of the  
plant lose water faster. Higher levels of natural rainfall  
reduce the need to irrigate. (Make sure you know not only  
what the annual rainfall is, but also what the distribution  
of rainfa ll is throughout the year).  
Conditions in the root zone  
Does the root zone drain freely -  What is the medium - s ability  
to retain water -  Does the medium repel water when dry  
(increasing surface run off) -  
 
 
 CHAPTER 12 : VEGETABLE CROPS   
 
 
 
Artichoke (Globe) Cynaria scolymus Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Perennial, needs moist conditions both in air and root  
environment. Does not tolerate extreme temperatures, hot dry  conditions reduce the tenderness of the crop.  
Nutrient requirements  
Requi res higher than average potassium  
levels. pH 6.5 -  7.5 
Suitable systems  
Perlite at 25cm depth or greater gives good results.  
Planting  
Propagate from stem cuttings or offshoots containing roots. Seed -  
grown plants give unreliable crops.  
Replant after fiv e years.  
Space plants at around 1 metre intervals.  
Special cultural techniques  
Frost protection and summer shading needed.  
Normally cut back hard after harvest in late spring or summer.  
Problems  
Water stress causes bud not to be compact.  
Pest problems can include rodents, snails, slugs,  
leafminers, caterpillars, aphis and birds.  
Disease problems can include fusarium, botrytis and virus.  
Harvest and post harvest  
The swollen, immature f lower bud is harvested continuously  
from late autumn to late spring.  
Harvest when buds reach the preferred size, but before they  
begin to open.  
Crops best in 2nd and 3rd years.  
Artichoke (Jerusalem) Helianthus tuberosus Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Does not tolerate extremely hot conditions (though it can do  
well in the tropics if shaded).  Requires temperatures between 19 and 27 degrees C.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.5  
Sensitive to higher than normal levels of boron.  
Nutrients as for globe artichoke but much higher phosphorus.  
Suitable systems  
Does very well in aggregate culture (particularly  
sand). Not suited to rockwool or water culture.  
Perlite at a minimum depth of 25 cm gives good results.  
 
 
Planting  
Plant divisions at 35 -  40 cm spacings late winter.  
Special cultural techniques  
Shade in very hot weather.  
Pull media up around stems periodically as it grows to  
ensure tubers are well covered.  
Remove f lowering shoots.  
Problems  
Fungal rots, particularly Sclerotium rolfsii, are difficult to  
contro l once they attack.  
Pests are rarely serious.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest 3 to 4 months after planting when foliage dies down.  
 
Asparagus Asparagus officinalis  
Liliaceae Growing conditions  
Grows best at temperatures between 15 and 25 degrees  
C. Requires deep, well aerated medium.  Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeder requiring a higher than average  
EC. Phosphorus and potassium should be at  
high levels. pH 6.0 -  6.8 
Has a high boron requirem ent. 
Suitable systems  
Asparagus needs to be planted deep.  
Aggregate culture is best in a bed at least 25cm  
deep. Coarse sand has been successful.  
Sutherland recommends perlite for good  
results. Media must be well aerated.  
Gravel culture is considered sui table.  
Maxwell suggests no advantage over soil, therefore  
limited commercial prospects.  
Planting  
Propagated by seed or division.  
Seedlings take 2 -3 years before the first harvest. Lift  
seedlings during dormant period (winter), trim roots, cut off  
remain s of old leaf stalks and store in moistened peat  
moss until buds begin to swell (late winter/early spring),  
then transplant into hydroponic media spacing plants 15 cm  
apart.  
Special cultural techniques  
Intercropping in first 2 years while plants are establishing.  
Problems  
Occasionally aphis, white f ly and caterpillars can be a minor  
problem.  
 
 Insect damage is rarely serious.  
There are relatively few fungal problems. In some places crops  
are sprayed w ith copper fungicides (e.g. Bordeax or Kocide) to  
prevent fungal diseases.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Yield per unit area is relatively low making it less suitable for  
commercial hydroponics than other crops.  
Aubergine see Eggplant  
 
Bamboo Shoots  
Cultivati on of bamboo for food production is considered a highly  
specialised art in Japan. Bamboo can take up to seven years  
from planting to reach harvestable stage. New shoots for harvest  
must be covered to prevent them becoming bitter. Bamboo is a  
rhizomatou s plant and can spread very vigorously.  
Commercial hydroponic production of bamboo is at least  
very rare, although some home hydroponic growers have  
experimented with it. Its intolerance to - wet feet - , along with  
its potential to spread vigorously, li mit the suitability of bamboo  
as a hydroponic crop.  
 
 
Bean (Common) Phaseolus vulgaris Papillionaceae  
Growing conditions  
Needs plenty of moisture.  
Never let it become waterlogged.  
Nutrient requirements  
Regular supply of nutrient will result in rapid growth  
and early cropping.  Phosphorus, potassium and sulphur levels high but  
nitrogen not as high as with other vegetables.  
The ratio of nitrogen to potassium should be roughly equal.  
Sensitive to excessiv e boron.  
EC should be around 4.0mS/cm early in the crop, decreasing to  
2.0 at harvest.  
Yields decrease significantly at high EC levels close to  
or after f lowering.  
pH is best around 6.0 and never below 5.5.  
Nutrient solution as follows:  
 
NUTRIENT  
PPM  
Nitrogen (as nitrate)  
180 -  270 
Phosphorus  
40 
Potassium  
210 -  350

Suitable systems  
Beans yield prolific crops under hydroponic systems -  at the  
height of the season, the first beans are ready for  
picking 8 to 9 weeks after sowing. While all varieties  
perform well, climbing varieties offer the advantage that  
they do not take up as mu ch room.  
Most aggregate media 10 cm or more deep give excellent  
results. NFT, sand, sawdust and most aggregate systems  
which have been tried have been successful.  
Seeds have been germinated in  
NFT. Maxwell suggests sand and  
perlite.  
In the Netherlands,  yields of climbing beans in rockwool  
have been better than in soil. Slabs used where 7.5 cm deep  
and 15 -  20 cm wide with 4 to 5 plants per slab. Slabs were  
heated at 15 to 18 degrees C in the early stages.  
 
 
Planting  
Seeds should be sown singly, ata spacing of 10 cm between  
seeds. pH levels should be maintained at 6.0; pH below  
5.5 will significantly affect growth during early stages.  Special cultural techniques  
Trellis is needed, particularly for climbers which can grow  
up to  
2.5 m tall.  
Pests  
Red spider -  minute insects on the underside of leaves,  
which cause leaf mottling and eventual death. They can be  
detected by the presence of a reddish tinge or webbing  
under the leaf. Spray with malathion; alternatively a   
population of predatory mites could be released into the  
greenhouse.  
Bean f ly -  larvae of this f ly cause damage to the plant by  
burrowing into the stems. Control by spraying with  
malathion.  
Thrips -  These tiny insects reduce pod set by damaging th e  
flowers. Spray with malathion.  
Diseases  
Mosaic viruses pose a significant problem to bean growers.  
There are several strains which can infect the plant via aphis  
transmission. The common mosaic bean virus causes new  
leaves to crinkle and stiffen; old er leaves have chlorotic mottling  
and underturned margins. There are no satisfactory remedies for  
viral diseases, however mosaic -resistant varieties have been  
developed.  
Varieties  
Different varieties need different temperature conditions.  
Flat pod varieties (e.g. Kwintus) have been grown  
successfully in the Netherlands in rockwool.  
Beetroot Beta vulgaris Chenopodiaceae  Growing conditions  
It will grow in semi -shade (making it adapte d to intensive  
culture). Full sunlight is not necessary, but reasonable light levels  
are preferred.  
Nutrient requirements  
Needs a good supply of potassium and calcium.  
Will also use chlorine and sodium more than many other  
plants. Has a high boron requi rement (0.25 ppm or higher).  
Responds to high levels of manganese, copper, iron,  
and molybdenum.  
pH 6.0 to 6.5.  
Will tolerate very high EC levels (over 5.0 mS/cm).  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Can give excellent results in most aggregate culture medium  
(minimum de pth of 10 cm) though not any better than in soil  
culture.  
Some suggest it takes too much space and too long to grow  
in hydroponics.  
Planting  
Sow seeds direct, using twice as much seed as will be  
needed, into aggregate culture. Seedlings should then be  
thinned to a spacing of 15 cm X 30 cm between rows.  
Germination rates can often be poor.  
They can be started in sand and transplanted when 6 -  8 cm  
high, though transplants might not grow as well as  
plants sown direct.  
Problems  Pest and disease problems  are minimal.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Commercial viability is unlikely in hydroponics.  
Harvesting of large, tender roots can be done nine to  
ten weeks after initial sowing.  
Broad Bean Vicia faba Papillionaceae  
Hydroponic culture doesn - t give any better result than soil.  
Growing conditions  
Hot, dry weather reduces cropping.  
Nutrient requirements  
Similar to common bean.  
Tolerates higher levels of boron than the common  
bean. pH 6.0 -  6.5 
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture gives very good results, but not  
discernably better than soil culture.  
Media should be 15 cm or more deep.  
Not considered suitable for commercial growing.  
Planting  
As for common bean.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis required.  
Shading may be  
needed. Problems  
Aphis can damage tip growth (control with pyrethrum  
near to cropping, control with malathion early in the  
season).  
Excess moisture can cause root rot.  
Harvest and post harvest  3 to 4 months after planting.  
 
 
Broccoli Brassica oleraceae - Botrytis group C ruciferae  
Broccoli is easier to grow in hydroponics than other  
brassicas. Growing conditions  
Sensitive to poor aeration -  hence best in the better  
draining media with more frequent than normal applications  
of nutrient.  
Nutrient requirements  
Good level s of nitrogen and phosphorus during  
development. Iron is also important  
Has a high boron requirement (0.25 ppm is suggested).  
Heavy feeders, requiring a higher than normal EC (up to 3.5  
mS/ cm early in the crop and up to 3.0 mS/cm at maturity).  
pH 6.0 to  6.8. 
Suitable systems  
Most systems are suitable. Aggregate systems are probably  
best. NFT growpots have been used successfully.  
Planting  
Seeds can be sown direct or in tubes of perlite which can  
later be sat in NFT channels.  
Spacing should be 30 X 30 cm . 
Special cultural techniques  
Plant support is necessary, and may be critical if there is  
wind exposure.  
Problems  
Grubs can be a serious problem in the heads -  pest control  
is essential.  Harvest and post harvest  
Broccoli heads should be ready for picking 9 to 11 weeks  
after planting and will bear for a further two to three  
months.  
The heads should be picked well before there is any sign  
of f lowering and should be cut with 5 cm of stalk attached.  
 
Brussels spro uts Brassica oleraceae -  Gemifera group  
Cruciferae  
 
Growing conditions  
Brussels sprouts require cool to cold (i.e. frosty) weather to  
develop adequate, tightly -formed hearts.  
Need a well -aerated medium and frequent irrigations.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nitrogen, phosphorus and iron are particularly important.  
Have a high boron requirement.  
Recommended EC of 3.0 mS/cm while establishing, reducing  
to 
2.5 mS/cm when cropping.  
pH 6.5  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Media 10 cm or more deep.  
Some consider these plants too large for  
commercial hydroponic growing.  
Planting  
Direct sow seeds or plant from tubes in late  summer. Final spacing should be 45 X 45 cm  
between plants  
Special cultural techniques  
Some form of support or trellising is ess ential.  
Problems  
Amateur gardeners frequently have difficulty getting a clean crops.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Brussels sprouts take up to seven months to mature. Hearts  
should be harvested when they are still small and firm as f  
lavour is lost when they mature and open up.  
 
 
Cabbage Brassica oleraceae -  Capitata group Cruciferae  
Growing conditions  
Aeration should be very high.  
Constant moisture is important.  
Ideally temperatures above 13 degrees C at all times.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nitrogen, phosphorus  and iron are particularly important.  
Has a higher than average boron requirement.  
EC at around 3.0 initially dropping to 2.5  
later. pH 6.5 to 7.0  
Suitable systems  
Excellent results from aggregate culture.  
Should suit most aggregate culture.  
Minimum aggregate depth of 10 cm.  
Has been successfully grown on a bench system, similar to  
lettuce. Good results have also been obtained from NFT  
systems.  Compared with soil, production is not normally high enough  
to justify commercial hydroponic growing.  
Planting  
Smaller varieties can be sown at a distance of 30 X 30 cm  
between plants.  
Larger varieties will need to be spaced 45 X 45 cm apart.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellising is not required.  
Problems  
Cabbage  white butterfly grubs must be controlled.  
Other pests can include aphis, f lea beetles, maggots and  
cutworm. Diseases will be better controlled in hydroponics than  
in soil; however cabbage can be attacked by several fungi  
including fusarium, downy mild ew and alternaria leaf spot.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Cabbages can be stored for a month or more after harvest at 0 to  
3 degrees C and low relative humidity.  
Varieties  
There are varieties available to crop at all times of the year  
 
 
Capsicum Capsicum annu m var. annum Solanaceae  
Growing conditions  
Optimum temperatures for fruit development are 22 -23  
degrees C by day and 18 -  19 degrees C at night.  
Vegetative growth is best at temperatures between 25  
and 30 degrees C.  
Strongly -growing plants can withstand high temperatures  
(i.e. over 30 degrees C) although 35 degrees C and above are  harmful. Humidity levels should be maintained at around  
75%. Lower levels of humidity may cause f lower abortion  
while higher levels en courage botrytis problems.  
Semi -shade is not only tolerated but desirable in warm areas.  
Nutrient requirements  
Capsicums require a soil pH of 6.0 to 6.5.  
Growth is best if the EC reading can be kept low (but still  
supplying adequate nutrition).  
Initially a ratio of 4 parts nitrogen to I part phosphorus to 5  
parts potassium will encourage a higher potash formula  
to encourage f lower formation, e.g. NPK 5:1:10.  
Supply nitrogen as nitrate. Do not use ammonium form.  
Calcium, magnesium and boron levels should  be higher  
than normal.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate systems with most media, 10 cm deep, give  
excellent results.  
Black poly bags filled with sand and drip irrigated have  
been very successful.  
Perlite/sand mix or straight perlite in foam boxes or beds  
have also given good results.  
Rockwool slabs have given excellent results.  
While some people claim success with NFT, this  
method is generally unsuitable for commercial  
production.  
Planting  
Seedlings are planted at 30 to 40 cm spacings.  
Special cultural techniques  
Early forming f lower -buds are removed to encourage initial  vegetative development. The plant should be at least 40 cm  
tall before flowers are allowed to develop.  
Capsicums requir e a support system. There are two  
methods which can be used:  
Problems  
Early forming f lower buds are removed to encourage  
initial vegetative development.  
The plant should at least be 40 cm tall before f lowers are  
allowed to develop.  
Capsicums require a  support system. There are two  
methods which can be used:  
1. Vertical string supports  
Only 3 -  4 leaders per plant are allowed to grow up the  
string; side shoots are suppressed at the first or  
second leaf stage. If a double planting density is used,  
only 2 leaders per plant are used.  
 
 
2. Horizontal Nets  
Nets with a mesh size of 20 cm are used to support the plants.  
Nets should run every 30 cm with the lowest being 50cm  
above the f loor. Side shoots do not have to be suppressed  
under this method.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Strong winds can be a serious problem.  
Insect pests can include aphis, weevils, maggots, f lea beetles,  
leaf miners and caterpillars.  
The most serious diseases are virus problems which are  
transmitted by aphis (for this reason ap his control is  important).  
Carrot Daucus carota var. sativa Apiaceae  
Carrots are frequently difficult to grow in hydroponics (because  
roots don - t form as well as in soil) though I have seen occasional  
success achieved by hobbyists.  
Short -rooted varieti es are much easier in hydroponics than  
others.  
Growing conditions  
Warmth, good drainage and good aeration are essential.  
Nutrient requirements  
Minimise nitrogen and maintain good levels of phosphorus and  
potassium.  
If you lower levels of calcium nitrate to minimise nitrogen  
you will also reduce calcium supply. To compensate you must  
supply additional calcium in some other way.  
pH 6.3  
EC should never go above 2.0 mS/cm  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture is the only worthwhile method. Coarse or  
heavy med ia do not succeed.  
A medium such as 30% vermiculite and 70% perlite may give  
the best result.  
A deep bed is required.  
Sutherland reports excellent results with perlite 15 to 30 cm  
deep though other authorities report failure in perlite.  
Carrots are not a viable commercial crop in hydroponics.  
Planting  
Sow direct into vermiculte/perlite bed or sand/vermiculte  
bed.  Problems  
While pest and disease problems are relatively few, aphis an d  
leaf hoppers can occur and several fungal diseases can arise  
from time to time, particularly in excessively wet conditions.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Carrots can be lifted at any stage of growth.  
In a home hydroponic garden, thinning to allow some carro ts to  
grow bigger will yield smaller carrots to eat.  
 
 
Cauliflower Brassica oleraceae -  Botrytis group Brassicaceae  
Growing conditions  
Needs good aeration.  
Root environment conditions must remain relatively  
constant -  irregular growth rate decreases cr op production.  
The optimum temperature both while developing through  
harvest is 15 to 20 degrees C.  
Crowding is not a significant problem. Cauliflowers will  
grow closer together in hydroponics than in soil.  
Nutrient requirements  
EC should be between 1.5  and 2.0  
mS/cm pH 6.5 -  7.0 
Iron, phosphorus and nitrogen are most  
important. Has a higher than average boron  
requirement.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate -  most media are suitable provided you have a  
minimum of 10 cm.  
Successful results have been reported in gravel, sand and a  sand/ perlite mix.  
NFT has also given good results.  
Planting  
Sow seeds direct or from tubes in late  
summer. Final spac ing should be 45 X 45  
cm. 
Special cultural techniques  
Direct sunlight on the curd can cause yellowing (reduce  
market quality).  
Sometimes leaves are tied together over the curd to improve  
whiteness.  
Problems  
Most diseases and pests which affect cabbages also  
affect cauliflowers.  
Diseases include phytophthora, root rot, and viruses.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest before curds overmature.  
Trim outer leaves and cool with fan -forced air as soon as  
possible after picking.  
 
 
 
 
 
 capsicums  
 
 
Celery Apium graveolens var. dulce Apiaceae  
Growing conditions  Prefers cool or part -shade in warmer months.  
Good aeration is essential.  
Optimum day temperatures are 16 to 21 degrees C.  
Temperatures below 10 degrees C can cause seed stalk  
development.  
Nutrient requirements  
A good level of nitrogen is essential.  
Taste is improved by adequate supply of chlorine and  
sodium. Has a higher than average boron requirement.  
pH 6.5  
Suitable systems  
Good results in most media in aggregate culture (minimum  
depth of  10cm).  
NFT culture has also given good results in non - 
commercial systems.  
Rockwool slabs have given excellent results.  
Commercial viability of celery in hydroponics is questionable.  
Planting  
Space 12 cm apart  
Special cultural techniques  
Plant densely to create a blanching effect while growing.  
Wrap stems in paper or black plastic for 1 month before  
harvest to blanch.  
Problems  
Subject to many different pests, diseases and other disorders.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Force cool quickly as soon as possible after harvest.  
Storage at 0 -  4 degrees C and 90% humidity extends the shelf  
life considerably.   
 
Chicory Cichorium intybus Asteraceae  
Chicory is sometimes commercially grown in hydroponics  
in any of the following ways:  
1. Dormant crowns grown in the ground are planted in  
hydroponics and sprouted -  the large head of leaves  
which emerges is harvested before it bursts open and  
eaten as a salad vegetable.  
2. Seedlings are grown from the beginning in hydroponics  
to produce crowns which are eaten as a salad  
vegetable.  
3. Seedlings are grown in hydroponics to produce roots  
which are cooked and eaten like carrots.  
Growing conditions  
Sprouting crowns: keep at 13 to 15.5 degrees C and in total  
darkness until the shoot s are approximately 18 cm tall,  
then harvest.  
Nutrient requirements  
Similar nutrient formulae to  
lettuce. pH 5.5 to 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
NFT or semi -NFT (i.e. NFT with the gullies filled with  
gravel). Aggregate: must be well aerated and constantly  
moist.  
Planting  
Sow seeds in trays or boxes of 60% sand and 40%  
vermiculite. Transplant to permanent position later in soil  
or gravel bed. Grow to maturity.  If grown in soil, lift growns and trim o ff any side shoots.  
Store at temperatures between 0 and -5 degrees C for several weeks.  
This cold temperature stimulates development of the f lower  
buds. Wash then transplant into hydroponic media. Maintain  
a higher temperature in the root zone than in t he air above  
i.e. 15 to 20 degrees C in the root zone and 12 to 17 degrees  
C in the air. The primary f lower bud develops quickly,  
swelling to 6 to 8 cm and weighing up to 120g in 3 to 4  
weeks, at which time it is harvested  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvested shoots which are thoroughly blanched have  
the best f lavour.  
Flavour deteriorates as the harvested shoots turn green.  
Corn (Sweet) Zea mays var. rugosa Poaceae  
 
 
  
 
 
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeding is required during  
establishment. pH 6.0  
An E C of 2.5 mS/cm or higher can reduce yield.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate -  most media should succeed at a minimum depth  
of 15 cm.  
Success has been reported in sand beds.  
NFT systems have also given good  
results.  Yields are relatively low per cubic metre and commercial  
application in hydroponics is questionable.  
Planting  
Sow direct into aggregate or into rockwool propagating  
blocks.  
Problems  
Corn is prone to attack by a range of insect pests, fungi,  
bacterial an d virus diseases.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest when kernels reach full size and turn yellow. This is  
best determined by examining directly.  
Flavour deteriorates rapidly after harvest. For best f lavour  
eat within 2 hours of harvesting, or freeze on h arvest.  
Cucumber Cucumis sativis Cucurbitaceae  
Growing conditions  
Needs day temperatures of 24 -  30 degrees C. Tolerates  
over 38 degrees C.  
Requires high levels of water (i.e. needs frequent irrigations  
and prefers high humidity).  
Semi -shade may be nece ssary in warm climates or mid  
summer.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH should be around 5.5.  
In general, a standard nutrient solution with a ratio of  
approximately 4 nitrogen to 6 potassium to 1 phosphorus will  
give good results.  
Ratios between nutrients should be maintained approximately as  
follows during all stages of the crop:  
-  2 parts K to 1 part ca  -  10 parts K to 1 part Mg  
The only variation might be a slight increase in the  
proportion of potassium during fruit formation and development.  
While maintaining the nutrient ratios you should vary the  
amount of nutrient powder you dissolve in solution at different  
stages of the crop to achieve EC  readings as follows:  
Early while the plants are establishing: 2.0 mS/cm.  
From when the plants reach about 1 metre tall until 3 to 4  
weeks after the first harvest: 2.5 mS/cm  
Between 3 and 7 weeks after the first harvest: 2.0  
mS/cm Beyond 7 weeks after th e first harvest: 1.7  
mS/cm  
An EC of 3.0 mS/cm has been found to reduce crop  
yield. Keep sodium and chlorine levels as low as  
possible.  
Over 50 ppm sodium can cause problems.  
 
 
Sulphur is best kept between 30 and 60 ppm.  
Nitrogen should be as nitrate an d not  
ammonium.  
Iron is needed at higher levels (up to 3 ppm) early in the  
growing season, but can be reduced as the plants  
mature.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture is successful in most media at 10 to 15 cm  
depth. Perlite has been successful in commercial  
production.  
NFT systems have also given excellent results but are not as  successful as aggregate culture commercially because  
roots can clog t he gullies and impair f low of nutrient  
solution.  
Rockwool has been used commercially in the Netherlands  
and the UK.  
Planting  
Seed can be started in rockwool or sand and  
transplanted. Direct seeding is effective  
because seeds are so large.  
Space plants  15 cm apart.  
Special cultural techniques  
Pinch out terminal buds to encourage branching and  
stimulate female flower development. (Note: male and  
female flowers are separate but on the same plant).  
Applications of silver nitrate and gibberellic acid will   
promote male f lowers. Ethephon will promote female f  
lowers.  
Trellising is required. Be careful tying stems as they can be brittle.  
Problems  
Wind protection may be necessary.  
Diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew,  
anthracnose, fusarium wilt , scab, alternaria leaf spot,  
bacterial wilt and several virus diseases.  
Pests include cucumber beetle, squash bug, leaf miner,  
leaf hoppers, aphis and spider mites.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Once in production, a crop is picked every one to three days.  
Quality in terms of colour and seed size deteriorates if  
fruits are allowed to get too large.  Cool and store between 7 and 10 degrees c on harvest (colder  
temperatures can damage the fruit).  
Varieties  
New mildew resistant strains are easier to grow.  
More compact -growing types such as apple cucumbers are  
more adaptable to hydroponics, though other types have  
been grown commercially with success.  
 
 
Endive Cichorium endiva Asteraceae  
Growing con ditions  
Well suited to hydroponic culture.  
Similar growing conditions to Chicory.  
Nutrient requirements  
As for chicory.  
pH around 5.5.  
Suitable systems  
NFT pipe systems have given good results.  
Aggregate culture has also been successful.  
Planting  
Simila r to lettuce.  
Special cultural techniques  
Blanched by tying leaves up to stop light reaching the centre  
or - heart -  of the plant.  
Blanching reduces bitterness of the crop.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Cut at ground level and remove outer green leaves at harvest.  
 
 Eggplant Solanum melongena Solanaceae  
Growing conditions  
Needs warmth and low humidity.  
Roots require good aeration and drainage but constant  
moisture and nutrient supply in the root environm ent. 
Nutrient requirements  
Basic nutrient should be similar to that used for  
tomatoes. Nitrate deficiency decreases yield.  
Nitrate excess also decreases yield and causes high  
nitrate levels in the fruits.  
Cut nutrient solution concentration by around 30%  as soon  
as fruits are seen to be forming. Return to normal feeding  
after harvest (you may well have several harvests in one  
season).  
Optimum nitrate levels are 6 -8 mg/litre, under greenhouse  
conditions in southern France.  
EC should be around 2.0  
mS/c m. pH 6.0  
Suitable systems  
Growing on rockwool slabs has given a significantly  
increased production over soil cultivation (i.e. 10 cm deep  
slabs and 2 plants per 90 cm slab).  
Maxwell suggests rockwool, NFT and aggregate culture as  
being commercially viable.  
Planting  
 
 
 
   
 
Higher summer temperatures are needed to initiate bulb or  
clove formation.  
Nutrient requirements  
Similar to onions.  
pH 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Most types of aggregate are successful with a minimum of 10 cm  
depth.  
Maxwell suggests sand culture.  
Sutherland reports good results in rockwool slabs, though  
this may be questionable for commercial use due to the danger of  
rockwool fibres adhering to cloves when harvested.  
Planting  
Divide and plant cloves in spring.  
Prob lems  
Aphis can attack foliage.  
Fungal rots can attack roots and cloves in over -wet conditions.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Lift autumn -planted crops in early autumn and spring  
planted crops in late autumn (N.B. It can take up to 10  
months from planting to h arvest).  
Store in a dark dry lace after harvest.  
Kale Brassica oleracea var. sabellica Brassicaceae  
Kale is somewhat similar to cabbage. It can be expected to grow  
under similar conditions and have similar nutrient requirements.  
Aggregate cultures are likely to give the best results.  
Kale plants can reach heights of 50cm and may require support  structures.  
 
 
Leek Allium ampeloprasum Amaryllidaceae  
Growing condition s 
Similar to onions, but a cool season crop, planted in summer  
for winter maturity.  
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeders needing frequent applications of nutrient  
solution. Phosphorus is most important, nitrogen next in  
importance and phosphorus next.  
pH 6.5 to 7.0  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate gives excellent results in most media 10 cm or  
deeper. Perlite gives good results.  
Good results have been reported on rockwool slabs.  
Planting  
Sow seed into perlite or rockwool propagation blocks.  
Special cultural te chniques  
Cutting the tap root will reduce chances of plants going to  
seed in warm conditions.  
Blanched by placing a collar, or tying paper around the stem.  
Problems  
Similar to onions.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Six to seven months from planting to harvest.  
Lettuce Lactuca sativa Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Growth needs to be fast and at an even rate (will mature in  40 -  85 days depending on variety).  
Shading may be needed in hot  
conditions. The root zone sho uld  
never overheat.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Vertical columns have been used in Poland.  
NFT has been used in England, Japan, and Australia.  
Modified NFT with gravel in gullies is very  
successful.  
Coarse aggregate culture gives excellent results in any  
medium 10 cm deep.  
Rockwool gives excellent results and has been used  
commercially. Media with a greater cation exchange capacity  
are not suitable.  
Planting  
Germinate seed in vermiculite, perlite or rockwool propagation  
blocks, then transplant into syste m at 6 to 8 leaf stage.  
Sow direct into aggregate beds then thin out.  
Some growers buy in seedlings. This accelerates the crop  
turnover time and reduces labour, but there may be tradeoffs in  
quality, availability, or varietal choices.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove marked or damaged outer leaves.  Problems  
Irregular burst of growth can cause decreased quality or  
quantity of p roduce.  
Rapidly -grown lettuces are relatively free of disease.  
Excess water or poor aeration commonly causes yellow or  
rotting of the lower (outer) leaves.  
Some will burn on leaf tips if exposed to too much sunlight.  
Pests include aphis, f lea beetles, cr ickets, springtails, leaf  
hoppers, caterpillars, whitefly, slugs and snails.  
Aphis is of particular concern because it transmits viral diseases.  
Other disease problems include damping off (pythium),  
sclerotinia, downy mildew, powdery mildew, botrytis,  
rhizoctinia, and anthracnose.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Lettuce are ready to pick after four weeks in summer.  
Rockwool grown plants can be harvested with roots intact,  
still in the rockwool -  this significantly improves the keeping  
quality. Damaged or ma rked leaves should be removed at  
harvest.  
Lettuce should be cooled rapidly after harvest, in order to  
maximise shelf life.  
Store at between 2 and 4 degrees C under high humidity.  
Varieties  
Hydroponics is especially suited to the production of the  
small, fancy leaf type lettuces. Commercial growers will find it  
necessary to source varieties for different seasons.  
Mignonette can be grown all year (with the aid of a greenhouse in  
cooler clim ates).  
Some varieties are slower bolting, reacting more slowly to higher  temperatures. These are most suited to grow in warmer  
months.  
Marrow  
Vegetable marrow, squash etc see zucchini (treat similarly).  
Spaghetti marrow is not as good as other types, ac cording to  
Sutherland.  
Melon Cucumis melo Cucurbitaceae  
 
 
Growing conditions  
Hot, dry air environment with frequent  
irrigations. Root zone should never dry out.  
In hot weather each plant can use as much as 4 litres of  
water per day.  
In cool temperature climates substrate warming (to 25  
degrees C) is used to start greenhouse crops early in the  
season.  
Nutrient requirements  
EC should be kept around 2.0 to 2.5 mS/cm early in the  
season, then 2.5 or slightly higher once plants have  
established. An EC of  
3.0 or higher can reduce crop yield.  
Nutrient solution should be applied at a rate to allow  
about 20% of each irrigation to run off and be lost. This  
helps wash away any build -up of sodium, which can be a  
problem.  
Potassium should be increased a little during fruit  
development. Nutrition requirements are similar to  
cucumbers.  pH 5.5 to 6.0  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool slab culture tends to produce a lar ger number of  
smaller fruit than soil culture (for this reason, larger  
fruiting varieties are preferred in rock wool). Melons are  
grown commercially in rockwool in the Netherlands.  
Good results in aggregate culture, most media at 10 cm deep.  
Planting  
Spacing depends on variety.  
Seed direct into perlite or rockwool or transplant seedlings.  
Special cultural techniques  
A plastic collar or mulch between the media and the  
foliage will help keep air humidity down.  
Keep fruit from sitting on moist surfaces.  
Trellis must be used to control direction of growth.  
Problems  
Pests can include aphis, cutworms, leafhoppers and spider  
mites. Diseases can include powdery and downy mildew,  
fusarium and anthracnose.  
May need hand pollinating.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Rock  melons are picked when the fruit comes away from the  
stem easily. They are at their best three days later, after  
storage at 21 degrees C.  
Watermelons are ripe when the surface of the fruit  
becomes slightly bumpy and the underneath becomes  
slightly yellow.  
Varieties  
Honeydew melon Cucumis melo -  Inodorus group  Rock melon, cantaloupe or musk melon Cucumis melo -   
Reticulatus group.  
 
Okra Abelmoschus esculentus Malvaceae  
Growing conditions  
Need good aeration and  
drainage. Requires frequent  
irrigations.  
 
 
Needs ample warmth (around 24 to 26 degrees C).  
Nutrient requirements  
Good nitrogen supply important.  
Okra is a heavy feeder.  
pH 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
NFT used in Australia.  
Planting  
Soak seeds in water for two days before sowing.  
Special cultural requirements  
Requires support system.  
Problems  
Verticillium wilt is a particularly serious problem. Several other  
fungal diseases can occur, including fusarium wilt and some  
leaf spot fungi.  
Aphis and a number of other insect pests may present a  
problem.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest daily starting 8 to 10 weeks after planting. If pods are  allowed to stay on the  plant after they attain full size (i.e. 10  
to 15 cm long) quality deteriorates fast.  
On harvest, rapidly cool and store at 7 to 10 degrees C and 90%  
humidity. Lower temperature can injure the fruits.  
Onion Allium cepa Amaryllidaceae  
Growing conditions  
A relatively dry situation -  low humidity, good drainage and  
aeration and minimum irrigations.  
Requires good air movement around foliage to minimise fungal  
problems.  
Nutrient requirements  
High levels of potassium and nitrogen.  
pH 6.0 to 7.0  
Manganese, c opper, zinc and molybdenum are important  
micronutrients.  
Tolerates high levels of boron but only has a moderate  
boron requirement.  
N:P:K ratio of 15:3:16.  
Reduce nitrogen and potassium levels as the crop develops.  
By mid -season nitrogen levels should de crease by 20%, and  
by the end of the season by 30%. Potassium can be dropped by  
up to 20% over the total life of the crop.  
EC should never go above 1.8 mS/cm.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture gives excellent results, though not  
significantly different from soil culture.  
Most media should be around 10 cm deep.  
Bulb onions take too long in hydroponics, given the crop - s value.  
Spring onions are quicker and may be viable in per lite, sand  or modified NFT (with gravel in the gullies).  
 
 
Planting  
Seed can be germinated in aggregate culture, or pre - 
germinated seedlings transplanted into the system.  
Special cultural techniques  
Cease irrigations on bulb -forming onions when bulb has  
attained full size.  
Allow the tops to almost completely die down, then lift and  
store. The weed free nature of hydroponic production may  
provide some advantage over soil -grown onion crops in  
terms of labour.  
Problems  
Too much water causes fungal proble ms. 
Pests include aphis, thrip, maggots and cutworms.  
Diseases include downy mildew, fusarium, botrytis,  
smut and several other virus and fungal problems.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Lift bulb onions after tops die down completely.  
Pull spring onions before the tops begin to die down.  
Pak-choi Brassica rapa - Pekinensis Group Cruciferae  
Growing conditions  
Requires a lot of moisture, but reasonable  
drainage also. Growth ceases at temperatures  
below 10 degrees C.  
Nutrient requirements  
EC 1.5 to 2.0 mS/cm  
pH 7.0  Otherwise similar nutrition to cabbage.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool slabs have proven successful.  
NFT or modified NFT with gravel could be worth trying.  
Planting  
Can suffer transplant shock.  
It is preferable to allow it to germinat e in its permanent position.  
Problems  
As for cabbage.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest 70 to 80 days after planting.  
Parsley Petroselinum crispum Apiaceae  
Growing conditions  
Tolerant of cold temperatures.  
Good aeration but constant moisture in the root zon e. 
Nutrient requirements  
Similar to  
carrots. pH 5.5  
-  6.0 
Suitable systems  
 
 
Excellent results in 30% perlite / 70% coarse sand at 20cm  
depth. NFT has been used but root rots are sometimes a  
problem.  
NFT, rockwool and most aggregate systems have been  
suggested by various hydroponics experts.  
Planting  
Space at 10 to 20 cm intervals.  Problems  
Few pest and disease problems.  
Some insects can mark foliage occasionally.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Cut 70 to 80  days from planting.  
Plants can be repacked several times over a season, then  
replanted for the next year.  
Store at 0 to 4 degrees C and high humidity.  
 
 
Parsnip Pastinaca sativa Umbelliferae  
Growing conditions  
Requires a very deep medium.  
Generally unsui ted to hydroponics, though some have had  
success in aggregate culture.  
Tolerates cold and frosts.  
Nutrient requirements  
Phosphorus is needed for good root development.  
Calcium, nitrogen and potassium are needed in larger  
than normal proportions.  
pH 6.0  
Suitable systems  
Commercial viability is highly questionable.  
Sutherland reports excellent results in perlite 25 cm deep.  
Planting  
Sow seed in perlite.  
Pea Pisum sativum Papillionaceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires good aeration, low humidity and frequent  irrigations with nutrient solution under warm conditions.  
Nutrient requirements  
Calcium, iron and phosphorus are particularly  
important. Adequate manganese is essential to achieve  
maximum cropping. pH 6. 0 to 7.0  
I suggest trying an NPK ratio of 8:1:5.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture should succeed with most media at a  
10 cm depth, or rockwool.  
Not generally suited to NFT (though we have had snow  
peas reported to have grown well in NFT).  
Planting  
Sow seed direct into permanent position or start in  
rockwool propagating blocks.  
Special cultural techniques  
Tall types require trellis/supports.  
Problems  
Relatively few apart from some insects.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Yield is not high enough to make peas c ommercially  
viable in hydroponics.  
Varieties  
Tall and short varieties are available.  
Potato Solanum tuberosum Solanaceae    parsley  
 
 
Growing conditions  
Tubers must not be exposed to light.  
Media should not become too warm, though foliage can  withstand heat.  
Media must be deep (30 cm or deeper).  
Good drainage and aeration are  
essential.  
Some claim potatoes need a shorter growing period in  
hydroponics compared with soil.  
Nutrient requireme nts 
Heavy nutrient requirement.  
Requires higher levels of phosphorus, otherwise similar  
nutrition to tomatoes.  
pH must be 5.0 to 6.0.  
EC ideally between 2.0 and 2.5 mS/cm.  
NPK 7:1:9 (N.B. higher phosphorus than other vegetables).  
Heavy feeders, but becaus e they are sensitive to high EC levels,  
frequent applications of nutrient solution in a very well -drained  
system will give the best results.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture or granulated rockwool only are suitable.  
NFT or rockwool slabs are unsuitabl e. 
Potatoes grow easily in 50% sand and 50%  
perlite. Not suited to commercial hydroponic  
production.  
Planting  
Plant sprouting pieces of tuber direct.  
Special cultural techniques  
Media must be continually pulled up to cover any exposed  
tubers.  
Problems  
Prolonged absence of copper in nutrient reduces reproduction of  aphis.  
Increased zinc in solution also reduces aphis.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest when tops begin to die down.  
Red-skinned varieties have a better keeping quality.  
Pumpkin Cucurbita pepo var. pepo Cucurbitaceae  
Growing conditions  
Similar to cucumber but slightly lower temperature  
requirement.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH of 5.5 to 7.5.  
Nutrition similar to cucumber.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool very successful.  
NFT channels can become clogged with the large root system,  
reducing f low of system.  
Planting  
Sow seed direct in perlite, rockwool or sand; or transplant  
seedlings.  
 
 
Spacing depends on  
variety. Special cultura l  
techniques Trellis is  
generally required.  
Problems  
Similar to cucumbers.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest when fruit stem begins to shrivel. Remove  fruits by cutting.  
Store at 0 to 10 degrees C.  
Varieties  
There is considerable variation in growth habit from  
more compact bushes to very large sprawling plants.  
Radish Raphanus sativus Cruciferae  
Some growers have found radishes difficult in  
hydroponics but very easy in soil. Some have been  
successful with a ggregate culture.  
Growing conditions  
Shade is needed in hot areas.  
Aeration is important.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nitrogen and phosphorus are important.  
Iron is often difficult to absorb due to lack of fine root  
hairs. Iron is important.  
Sensitive to low l evels of  
manganese. Higher than average  
boron requirement. pH 6.0 to 7.0.  
Suitable systems  
Most aggregate media 10 cm deep, perhaps best in  
perlite, gravel, sand.  
Not suited to rockwool or NFT.  
Planting  
Sow seed direct.  
Problems  
Excess warmth can cause  
bolting. Pests and disease  
similar to turnip.  Harvest and post harvest  
Usually 4 to 6 weeks from sowing seed.  
 
 
Rhubarb Rheum rhabarnarum Polygonaceae  
Growing conditions  
Temperatures below 25 degrees C.  
The root environment should  be well aerated but with a  
constant supply of water and nutrient.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nutrition must be maintained at reasonable levels at all times.  
Phosphorus is particularly important.  
pH 5.5 to 6.0  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture gives excellen t results with most media at  
15 cm depth.  
Rockwool slabs have been used  
successfully. If in NFT, channels must be  
very wide.  
Planting  
Plant so the crowns barely appear above the surface of the  
medium. Propagated by division.  
Special cultural techniques  
Shading is sometimes used to get crops in warmer weather.  
Problems  
Frost ad a few fungal rot diseases are the only major problems.  
Harvest and post harvest  
When leaves turn down on the leaf stem they should be  
removed by pulling gently from the plant (do not cut).  Stems are eaten but the leaf is poisonous  
Spinach Spinacia oleracea Chenopodiaceae  
Growing conditions  
Prefers cool, shaded positions.  
Best betwee n 15 and 19 degrees  
C. Nutrient requirements  
Nitrogen is most important.  
NPK ratio should be 10:4:12.  
Sensitive to a lack of manganese, copper, molybdenum and  
iron. pH 6.0 to 7.0  
Suitable systems  
Most aggregate media at 10 cm deep give excellent results .  
NFT using Growpots or Vinidex channel.  
Rockwool slabs have given excellent results.  
 
 
Planting  
Sow seed in sand or perlite and transplant into  
hydroponic system at 6 -  8 leaf stage.  
Space plants 8 -  10 cm apart.  
Problems  
Chewing insects, slugs and sn ails can be a problem.  
Sweet potato Ipomoea Convolvulaceae  
Growing conditions  
Must have warm dry air conditions and shade in  
very hot conditions.  
Nutrient requirements  
Average rate of nutrient uptake -  neither heavy nor  
light. Potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium are  needed in higher than normal ratios.  
pH 5.5 to 6.0  
EC of around 2.0 mS/cm (sensitive to levels over 2.5mS/cm).  
Suitable systems  
Sand culture is w ell suited according to Sholto  
Douglas. Has been successful in perlite.  
Sand or gravel in foam boxes fed with dripper have been successful.  
Planting  
Cuttings approximately 20 cm long are half inserted in  
media and strike easily (cuttings should be shaded  until  
roots form).  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellising needed.  
Problems  
Several insect problems including moth grubs, beetles and  
weevils. Fungal diseases which cause rot.  
Harvest and post harvest  
3 to 6 months after planting.  
Taro Calocasia esculent a Araceae  
Growing conditions  
Grows most rapidly during the tropical monsoon season  
under wet, hot conditions.  
Drainage and aeration must be good.  
Nutrient requirements  
Requires an acid root  
zone. Suitable systems  
Run to waste (i.e. open) aggregate systems with sand or  
gravel have proven best.  
Sand or gravel are perhaps most suitable.  Planting  
 
 
Plant young suckers taken from the base of established  
plants, or sections of tuber containing a piece of leaf stalk.  
Space 30 cm apart and up to 1 m between rows.  
Special cultural techniques  
Push media up around base of plants as they grow, keeping  
tubers well covered.  
Problems  
Few.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest 6 -  8 months after planting.  
You should harvest around 8  kg per plant.  
Varieties  
The Dasheen varieties must always remain wet.  
The Eddoes varieties tolerate extremes of dry and wet in the  
media.  
Tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Solanaceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires 21 to 24 degrees C for optimum growth.  
Growth slows significantly below 18 or above 27 degrees C.  
Requires good aeration and drainage.  
In very hot conditions some shading is needed.  
Avoid very high humidity.  
Nutrient requirements  
Essential elements for proper growth and development in  
tomato production include oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon,  
phosphorus, calcium, sulphur, magnesium, manganese, iron,  copper, zinc, boron, and molybdenum. Any one of these elements  
may become a limiting factor in plant health.  
Regular feeding is needed to avoid stunted growth and reduced  
cropping.  
pH 6.0 to 6.5  
Before planting, irrigate the media with nutrient solution to  
achieve an EC of 5.0 mS/cm. maintain this feed strength for  
about a mont h and then decrease it gradually to 3.0 mS/cm  
over the next 8 weeks, then to between 2.0 and 2.5 mS/cm  
over the summer.  
The ratio of potassium to calcium should stay at 3:2  
throughout the life of the crop (N.B. some sources suggest a K:Ca  
ratio of 2:1) . Calcium to magnesium ratio should be 4:1.  
Shortage of calcium can lead to blossom end rot and can affect  
the size of the fruit. Calcium is usually applied as calcium  
nitrate in the range of 250 to 500 ppm.  
Potassium to nitrogen ratio should be 1.4:1` e arly in the crop but  
increased to 1.8:1 providing higher potassium later in the crop.  
Potassium is essential for good fruit quality, and higher  
levels can increase the fruits shelf life. Potassium levels can  
vary from 50 to 400 ppm without affecting yi elds, but higher  
potassium levels improve fruit quality such as dry matter and  
electrical conductivity of the juice, which enhances f lavour.  
Some growers use different concentrations of nitrogen for winter  
and summer crops, since tomato plants -  nitrogen  
requirements can vary significantly between winter and  
summer.  
Phosphate should be relatively low, at about 40 ppm  
throughout the crop. Hi gh phosphorus levels (over 100 ppm) can  result in iron deficiency  
 
 
Sodium and chlorine levels should be kept as low as  
possible. Trace elements are normally supplied in the  
following amounts, irrespective of the stage of  
growth:  
 
NUTRIENT  
PPM  
Iron 
1.00 
Manganese  
0.50  
Zinc 
0.40  
Boron  
0.30  
Molybdenum  
0.05  
Copper  
0.05  
 
Iron is important in hydroponic tomato cultivation. Some  
sources recommend iron levels of up to 5 ppm. Iron is  
added in the form of iron sulphate or as chelates containing  
iron. The chelate form is often preferred since the iron  
remains in solution and is relatively available over a wide pH  
range. The most popular compound is EDTA, but use of  this molecule may be restricted or prohibited in some  
countries because it does not break down in the  
environment, and has the potential to contaminate natural  
waters. Iron deficiency in nutrient solutions is one of the  
most common problems in container production of  
tomatoes. Symptoms can develop slowly and growers need  
to be constantly observant.  
Zinc levels are critical (below 0.25 ppm can cause deficiency  
and above 1 ppm can cause toxicity).  
Suitable systems  
NFT is the most commonly used method throughout the  
world. Multi -level NFT has shown great potential  
for increased production (in Poland).  
Under NFT systems the size of fruits decreases towards the  
bottom end of a channel (hence total production is  
decreased).  
Aggregate culture -  Sutherland reports excelle nt results in  
most aggregate culture at 15 cm depth. Growing tomatoes in  
pots is an easy and effective culture method and is widely  
used, both in the industry and by amateur growers. A  
variety of media have been used successfully including  
Perlite, ro ckwool, sand, and gravel. Some media are more  
effective than others and Perlite seems to be a good all  
round choice with many advantages -  such as its reusability,  
its absorbency and its drainage capacity.  
Rockwool is used commercially in the Netherlands and also  
has many advantages.  
 
 Planting  
Germinate seed in rockwool propagating blocks, or in  
vermiculite or perlite seed raising mixes, and transplant into  
your system.  
Special cultural techniques  
Prune out side shoots until f lowering  
commences. Trellising is necessary.  
Bees may need to be introduced for pollination in  
greenhouse crops. Other methods, such as mechanical  
vibration of plants, have also been used in greenhouse  
production to achieve opti mum pollination.  
Problems  
Blossom end rot is encouraged by any stress on the plant. Such  
stresses include irregular growth rate, inadequate oxygen levels  
around the plant root zone (resulting from poor nutrient  
solution or from heating of nutrient solut ions), disruptions to  
supply or balance of the nutrient solution, and inadequate plant  
uptake of calcium. It is worth noting that while calcium  
deficiencies are a direct cause of blossom end rot, a variety of  
factors (including the amount of dissolved oxygen and the  
temperature of the solution) can prevent tomato uptake of  
calcium from nutrient solutions, so addition of more calcium will  
not necessarily rectify the problem. Birds will attack ripe fruits.  
Pollination can be a problem in a greenhouse (wind and insects  
normally contribute towards pollination) various technologies  
have been utilised in greenhouse tomato production to overcome  
this pollination problem.  
Don- t smoke near tomatoes. A virus car ried in tobacco can  
infect the plants.  Other pests include aphis, fruit f ly, potato beetle, corn earworm,  
leafminer, white f ly and mites.  
Other diseases include anthracnose, bacterial canker, bacterial  
spot, blight, fusarium wilt, verticillium wilt an d leaf mould.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Can be harvested green or firm and pink. Fruit should be handled  
with care to prevent bruising or skin breakage. Damage  
can still be done when fruit are green, although it may not  
become evident until fruit starts to ripen. The main mechanical  
damage encountered in commercial tomato crops is bruising or  
skin breakage from impact, vibration or compression.  
Firm ripe tomatoes should be stored at 7 to 10 degrees C  
with 70 to 80% relative humidity and reasonable vent ilation.  
Storage at temperatures above this will increase respiration rates  
of harvested fruit and decrease shelf life.  
 
 
Turnip Brassica rapa - Rapifera group Cruciferae  
Growing conditions  
Cool conditions are essential for proper  
development. Media mus t be well drained and  
have good aeration. Avoid heavy gritty media.  
Nutrient requirements  
Phosphorus, potassium and iron are most  
important. Iron uptake can be a problem  
sometimes.  
Higher than average boron  
requirements. pH 6.0 to 6.5.  
Suitable systems  Perlite or vermiculite (or a mixture) are likely to give the  
best results.  
Planting  
Sow seed direct into perlite or vermiculite.  
Problems  
There are few problems in the edible root, though leaves are  
often att acked by insects.  
Harvest and post harvest  
2 to 3 months from planting to  
harvest. Cut leaves and wash roots  
at harvest.  
Water Chestnut Eleocharis dulcis Cyperaceae  
Growing conditions  
Chinese water chestnut grows as a semi -submerged plant and  
so is high ly suitable for hydroponic production.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nutrient requirements may be fairly small. Some  
authorities suggest that water chestnuts can be fed with old  
nutrient solution from other crops.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate -  media such as perl ite or vermiculite.  
Planting  
Small corms are planted in spring. Loose media is probably  
more approptiate for water chestnuts than rockwool.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Large corms are harvested after leaves die off in  
autumn. Corms will reach about 50 mm in diameter.  
Water Chestnuts are best used fresh but can also be canned  
and preserved in other ways. Commercial markets exist for  both fresh and preserved produce. A sian markets are likely  
to have high quality standards.  
 
 
Watermelon Citrullus lanatus Cucurbitaceae  
Growing conditions  
As for pumpkin, but higher temperatures.  
Ideally temperatures between 21 and 30 degrees C.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.8  
As for pumpkin  
Suitable systems  
As for pumpkin.  
Vigorous root systems can block pipes and beds.  
Not considered commercially viable in  
hydroponics.  
Planting  
Seed  direct  into  rockwool  propagating  blocks,  perlite   
or vermiculite.  
Problems  
As for zucchini  
Harvest an d post harvest  
Harvest when skin starts to become bumpy and undersurface  
starts to turn yellow.  
Varieties  
Smaller bush -type varieties are most suited to hydroponics.  
 
 
 Zucchini Cucurbita pepo Cucurbitaceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires a large area per plant to be productive. Good  
aeration and a constant supply of moisture and nutrient are  
essential.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.0  
Similar to pumpkin and cucumber.  
NPK ratio should be 10:3:10.  
Suitable systems  
NFT has given good results, although some growers prefer using  
aggregate culture because of disease problems.  
If grown too long in an NFT system, channels can clog with roots.  
Foam boxes filled with aggregate media 10 cm deep have been  
successful as a run -to-waste system.  
Bag culture could be economically viable.  
Planting  
Seed can be planted direct into aggregate or rockwool.  
Space plants at 35 -  45 cm intervals.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove diseased fruits or leaves as soon as they appear.  
Problems  
Pests include a phis, mites, leafhopper and other insects.  
Diseases include powdery and downy mildew, fusarium wilt,  
gummy stem blight, black rot, alternaria leaf spot,  
anthracnose and bacterial wilt.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Fruit needs to be regularly harvested to keep the plant producing  
well.  Harvest before 20 cm long.

 CHAPTER 13 : BERRY AND OTHER FRUIT CROPS   
 
  
Babaco Carica pentagona Caricaceae  
Also known as Highland or mountain Papaya which originated in  
the cool subtropical climate of Ecuador - s highlands. Cultivation is  
similar to Papaya, however Babaco can withstand cooler  
conditions and has been commerci ally produced hydroponically  
in temperate climate greenhouses. Minimum temperature  
conditions for crop development are 12 - 18 degrees C. Reaches  
2 metres in height at maturity with an average fruit size of 1 -  
1.4Kg. Averages 40 - 50 fruit per plant over  an 18 month  
growing period. Yields of 100 tons per hectare from 2 year  
old babaco plants in New Zealand have been recorded.  
Banana Musa acuminate Musaceae  
Growing conditions  
Average temperatures are best between 27°C and 29°C.  
Minimum temperature of 15 ºC and maximum of 35°C.  
Temperatures below 10 -15ºC reduce fruit quality, and frost  
kills the plant.  
Humidity should be high.  
Root zone should always be moist.  
Nutrient requirements  
NPK ratio of 12:1:16 is  
recommended. pH 5.5 to 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Due to the size of the plants, hydroponic growing is generally  
only relevant under glass in cooler climates where bananas  
would not normally grow. Not generally considered a  
commercially viable crop. Perlite or scoria at 40 cm deep give   
good results. Hydroponic bananas have been grown  successfully in Iceland.  
Planting  
Propagate bananas vegetatively by removing suckers which grow  
from the rhizome beside old plants. Only take suckers free of  
nematodes and bunchy top virus.  
Problems  
Fusarium wilt used to be a problem until wilt -resistant  
varieties were developed. Bunchy top virus is a major  
problem with bananas, and wind protection is essential.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Fruit takes around three months to mature from f lowering.  
The fi rst harvest is within a year of planting.  
Varieties  
Grow fusarium -resistant varieties such as Giant Cavendish,  
Valery and Robusta.  
 
 
Blackcurrant Ribes nigrum Saxifragaceae  
Growing conditions  
Blackcurrants are deciduous shrubs which require winter  
chilli ng to initiate fruiting.  
Nutrient requirements  
A recommended NPK ratio of  
10:1:6. pH of 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture is recommended. Though little  
information on hydroponic culture is available, being  
shallow -rooted they should adapt well, though commercial  
application is doubtful.  Planting  
Bushes should be planted 1.5 -1.8 m x 1.2 -1.5 m apart.  
Either one -year -old or two -year -old bushes can be  
planted. One -year - old bushes should be 45 cm high and  
have a minimum of two branches; two -year -old bushes  
should have 4 -5 branches, each over 60 cm long.  
Immediately after planting, branches should be pruned back  
to 1-2 buds above the growing medium.  
Special cultural techniques  
Black currants produce fruit on the previous season - s  
growth. Pruning should therefore encourage a supply of  
new growth each season. In the second season of growth,  
weak shoots and some of the older canes should be  
removed to  allow room for new growth. A framework of  
6-8 strongly -growing upright canes should be left. In  
subsequent years this procedure should be repeated; no  
basal canes should be allowed to grow for longer than  
three years.  
Problems  
There are few pest and d isease problems. Poor temperature  
conditions are the most common cause of crop failure.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Fruit matures in mid -summer and is borne on the  
bushes for a four -week period. The berries should be left  
on the bush until 99% of the crop is ripe. Mature bushes  
should produce up to 3 kg of fruit.  
Varieties  
Varieties which perform well include White Bud, Boskeep  
Giant, Carters Black Champion, Dunne t- s and Black  Naples.  
 
 
Blueberry Vaccinium spp. Ericaceae  
Growing conditions  
Roots must remain moist at all times.  
Nutrient requirements  
Blueberries require an acid pH level of around 4.0 to 5.0.  
Suitable systems  
Blueberries have been grown with moderat e success in  
50% sand and 50% peat mix. Commercial viability in  
hydroponics is doubtful.  
Planting  
Bushes should be planted at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m.  
Special cultural techniques  
Pruning of the bush in the first three years should be limited to  
removal  of dead and diseased wood. During this period, only the  
vegetative buds should be allowed to grow (rub off the plumper  
fruiting buds). After year 3, the bush will be large enough to  
permit shaping. In mid -winter, older wood should be cut back  
to 30 -40 cm to stimulate new shoots. Some branches may need to  
be fully removed to prevent overcrowding.  
Problems  
Blueberries are relatively free of pest and disease problems. One  
possible problem is the occurrence of botrytis (grey mould)  
which can affect f lowers and ripe berries in wet and humid  
conditions. Birds can be a problem if the plants are  
outdoors.  
Harvest and post harvest  Berries are ready for harvest in mid -summer w ith the fruit being  
borne on the bush for a period of six weeks. Berries should be  
allowed to ripen on the bush.  
 
 
Brambleberries Rubus occidentalis.  
Rosaceae (includes Bosenberry,  
Loganberry, Youngberry) Growing  
conditions  
The root zone must be well aerated but always moist. A  
cold period of dormancy is needed.  
Nutrient requirements  
A NPK ratio of 10:1:10 is suggested.  
Suitable systems  
Gravel, sand, perlite or rockwool should be successful.  
Brambleberries are not suitable for NFT as their vigorous  
root growth would block the channels. Commercial viability  
in hydroponics may be limited.  
Planting  
Plant in rows 1 to 2 metres apart (depending on the variety).  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis support and wind protection is necessary. Prune  
annually in winter while dormant, retaining half of the  
first year canes and half of the second season canes. The  
two-year -old canes will produce fruit the following  
summer and should then be removed the next winter to  
make way for fruiting wood.  
Problems  
Some types need bees for cross pollination.  Harvest and post harvest  
Pick continuously as berries ripen. Each plant should  
yield 1.5 to 2 kg per year.  
Citrus - Various species. Rutaceae  
Growing Conditions  
From temperate to topical depending on type grown.  
Hydroponic citrus is produced with use of greenhouse  
technology/protected cropping and containerised  
production where soils and climates are otherwise  
unsuitabl e. 
Nutrient requirements  
pH should be around 5.8 - 6.0 
N and Mg need particular attention. Foliar sprays of  
trace elements such as iron are beneficial in cooler climates.  
Potassium levels need to be maintained during the fruit  
production stages for good fruit quality.  
NPK ratios are species dependant.  
Suitable systems  
Containers of free draining media with drip irrigation of  
nutrient solution. Suitable substrates include rice hull,  
coconut fibre and similar combinations, although a wide  
range of hydrop onic media has proven successful.  
 
 
Special cultural techniques  
Often grown as grafted plants on dwarfing root stocks to  
minimise plant size at maturity and allow for protected  
cropping. Need regular pruning to maintain tree size, shape  
and productivity.  Problems  
Need correct temperatures (species dependant) for good  
flowering, fruit set and fruit development. Lemons, oranges,  
mandarins, and grapefruit are more cold tolerant t han tropical  
types such as limes and so can be produced more readily in  
temperate climates. Citrus requiring cooler conditions can be  
difficult to produce in tropical/ humid climates due to disease  
problems. Hydroponics citrus can be prone to mite and thrips  
infestations. Will not tolerate overwatering or saturated root  
zone conditions. Some varieties are prone to root rot pathogens.  
Harvest and Post harvest  
Need to be harvested at the correct stage of maturity for  
maximum storage life. Most citrus h ave a post harvest life of at  
least 2 weeks at room temperature conditions.  
Cherries - Prunus avium Rosaceae  
Sweet cherries can be grown hydroponically under  
protected cultivation or outdoors in large (at least 40  
litre) growing containers, beds or bags on grafted,  
dwarfing root stock. Hydroponic production allows careful  
application of nutrients and water and has been largely  
used to prevent the problems of fruit splitting on valuable  
fruit crops destined for export markets such as Japan where  
high quality fruit receives premium prices. Cultivation is  
similar to other fruit crops such as grapes and  
passionfruit.  
Grapes - Vitis viniifera Vitaceae  
Growing conditions  
Table grapes (mostly seedless) have long been produced  
hydroponically under greenhouse or protected cropping  conditions to produce high quality bunches often with the  
use of plant growth regulators for fruit set. Hydroponic  
production allows for the pr oduction of high quality fruit  
destined for export markets such as Japan. Grapes require a  
period of chilling, although this can be provided artifically  
where fruit is to be produced out of season. Warm conditions (  
18- 24º C) are required for bud brea k, f lowering and fruit  
development with good light levels for sugar production and high  
Brix fruit. Some hydroponic production of wine grapes is being  
researched, particularly in areas where the soil is infected  
with various pests and diseases.  
Nutrie nt requirements  
Nitrogen levels need to maintained from the time of bud break  
through to fruit set. Minimal nutrition during the dormancy  
period. Potassium and calcium are important when the vines are  
under high fruit loading to maintain sugars, acidity  and f lavour  
compounds. Deficient irrigation or application of high EC will  
improve the soluble solids contents and hence f lavour of the  
berries.  
Suitable systems  
Large growing containers for vines which may be cropped for  
over  
 
 
10 years - minimum of 40 litres of free draining growing media.  
Planting  
Grapes are obtained as grafted plants, many with resistance  
to Phylloxera. Individual plants need a large amount of  
growing space and support at maturity. Young plants  are often gro wn at a higher density and spaced out as the  
vines mature. Various methods of support are used with the  
most common being an overhead trellis system which allow  
the fruit to be harvested from underneath the vine.  
Special cultural techniques  
Grape vines need careful and heavy pruning for maximum  
fruit production and vine vigour. Leaf removal and fruit  
thinning may also be required for high quality table  
grape production.  
Problems  
Phylloxera beetle for vines without resistance. Common  
greenhouse pests and diseases such as mites, scale, whitefly,  
mealy bug and root rot diseases in unsterilised growing  
media and under over watered conditions. Lack of winter  
chill can reduce f lowering and fruit set. Botrytis (grey  
mould) under humid conditions and of the fruit post  
harvest.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Brix levels should be checked as fruit approaches maturity to  
determine harvest date for maximum sweetness. Fruits  
require careful handling to prevent bruising and  
bursting. Store chilled and separate bu nches with  
perforated plastic wraps.  
Varieties  
Many varieties of table and wine grape available. `Thompson  
seedless -  is the most important variety of table grape  
grown in many countries (white variety). Black Beauty,  
and Cardinal (red) are other popular table varieties.  
  
Passionfruit -  Passiflora edulis Passifloraceae  
Growing Conditions  
Purple passionfruit are perennial vines that are semi woody at  
maturity. Veg etative vine growth will occur year round provided  
temperatures are within 16 - 28º C and don - t drop below  
12º C for any length of time. Passionfruit can be grown in  
temperate climates but produce little or no growth through  
the winter period. Greenhou se grown passionfruit in cooler  
climates can be forced to continually f lower and fruit in f  
lushes so that fruit can be harvested year round. Day length  
extension through winter with supplementary light will force  
vines into f lowering under winter co nditions.  
Nutrient requirements  
A nutrient formulation high in nitrogen can be used for young  
seedlings and plants up until the time of fruit set, when  
potassium levels need to be boosted. The acidic pulp of  
passionfruit contains high levels of potassiu m and this needs to  
be maintained for maximum fruit f lavour. EC levels are  
recommended to be 1 - 1.5 for seedlings and 2 - 2.5 for fruiting  
vines. Fruiting formulations should contain at least 245 ppm of  
N, 269 ppm of K, 54 ppm of P, 48 ppm of Mg and 27 6 ppm of  
Ca. Recommended pH level is 5.9 - 6.0 
Suitable systems  
Large media filled containers (20 - 25 litres per plant) with  
substrates such as sawdust, composed pine bark, coconut  
fibre and similar media. Passionfruit has been successfully grown  
in rockwool slabs under greenhouse conditions in much the  
same way as long term tomato crops.  Planting  
Most passionfruit crops are started from seed which germinates  
readily at 24 - 26º C,  however grafted planted can also be used.  
Germination can take up to 6 weeks, but most seedlings appear  
within 3 weeks. Temperatures should be reduced to 20º C  
to harden off young plants before planting out. Light shading is  
beneficial under high ligh t conditions.  
Special culture techniques  
Passionfruit grow into a large, sprawling vine at maturity  
and need support and heavy pruning. Passionfruit vines are  
typically trained to four leader shoots which are trained  
upwards. Strings can be tied around each shoot and strung to an  
overhead wire. Another option is to use a trellis type system.  
Pruning will be required in the second and third years of growth  
since vines only bear fruit on current seasons growth. Plants  
are usually replaced after 2 - 3 years production. Purple passion  
fruit also require pollination, usually by bees but are self  
compatible. Flowers can also be pollinated by hand.  
Problems  
Lack of sufficient pollination causes fruit to be lacking in seed  
numbers and pulp. Flowering can be  inhibited by both low  
and high temperatures (above 30º C). Low light will  
reduce fruit set. Vines can suffer from Phytophthora root rot.  
Other disease problems include `Grease spot -  (bacterial) and  
many types of fungal root rots. Whitefly, mealy bug, green  
vegetable bug, aphids, mites and caterpillars are all common pest  
of passionfruit. Passionvine hopper is widespread in Australia  
and New Zealand  
  
and is the major pest of passionfruit crops.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Hydroponic passionfruit achieve yields of 20 tons per  
hectare at maturity. Mature fruit are either harvested from  
the ground beneath the vines once or twice a day or cu t from  
the vine which reduces skin damage and bruising. Fruit  
harvested from the vine must be fully coloured and close to  
natural fruit drop. Fruit is often washed and high quality  
fruit will have the calyx removed and stalk cut back to  
prevent damage  to other fruit during shipment.  
Varieties  
Purple Gold and E -23 are common purple types, although  
many others exist which may perform well in  
hydroponics.  
PawPaw Carica papaya Caricaceae  
Growing conditions  
Ideal temperatures are between 21°C and 27°C. Re quires  
full sun and no frost. Good aeration and drainage are  
important.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH should be around  
6.5. NPK  
recommended at  
7:1:18.  
Suitable systems  
Sholto Douglas reports excellent results in a greenhouse.  
Aggregate culture would be the system most likely to  
succeed.  Planting  
Pawpaw are normally propagated by seed. Plants can be  
any one of three sex types:  
1. Male only.  
2. Female only.  
3. Bearing f  lowers with both male and female parts.  
The male f lower plants do not bear fruit at all. These plants  
are discarded as soon as the sex is determined. Each plant  
requires a minimum of 3 square metres.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis and wind protect ion are essential.  
Problems  
Plants become too tall to be managed within a few  
years. When this happens, they need to be removed and  
replaced. Mites can be a serious problem, although regular  
spraying will alleviate this problem. Fruit f lies can be a  
significant pest. Fungal and viral diseases can also be a  
problem.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Trees can bear fruit within the first year and crop  
continuously, providing growing conditions are  
maintained.  
 
 
Pepino Solanum muricatum Solanaceae  
A small bush to 1 m tall and 1 m diameter, related to the  
tomato and producing a small oval fruit similar in taste to  
some melons.  
Growing conditions  Pepinos like a similar root environment to tomatoes. They  
are a lit tle more cold hardy than tomatoes, but can be killed by  
frost. Pepinos will grow in semi shade.  
Nutrient requirements  
Pepinos require oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus,  
calcium, sulphur, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc,  
boron, and molybdenum. Any one of these elements may become  
a limiting factor in plant health. Regular feeding is needed to  
avoid stunted growth and reduced cropping. They prefer a pH  
of 6.0 to  
6.5. Before planting, irrigate the media with nutrient solution to  
achieve an EC of 5.0 mS/cm. maintain this feed strength for  
about a month and then decrease it gradually to 3.0 mS/cm  
over the next 8 weeks, then to between 2.0 and 2.5 mS/cm  
over the summer.  
The ratio of potassium to calcium should stay at 3:2  
throughou t the life of the crop (N.B. some sources suggest a  
K:Ca ratio of 2:1).  
The calcium to magnesium ratio should be 4:1. Shortage of  
calcium can lead to blossom end rot and can affect the size of the  
fruit. Calcium is usually applied as calcium nitrate in the range of  
250 to 500 ppm. The potassium to nitrogen ratio should be  
1.4:1 early in the crop but increased to 1.8:1 providing higher  
potassium later in the crop. Potassium is essential for good fruit  
quality, and higher levels can increase the fruits shelf life.  
Potassium levels can vary from 50 to 400 ppm without affecting  
yields, but higher potassium levels improve fruit quality.  
Phosphate should be relatively low, at about 40 ppm  
throughout the crop. High phosphorus levels (over 100 ppm) can  result in iron deficiency. Sodium and chlorine levels should be  
kept as low as possible. Trace elements are normally supplied in  
the follo wing amounts, irrespective of the stage of growth:  
 
NUTRIENT  
PPM  
Iron 
1.00  
Manganese  
0.50  
Zinc 
0.40  
Boron  
0.30  
Molybdenum  
0.05  
Copper  
0.05  
Iron is important. Some sources recommend iron levels of up  
to 5 ppm. Iron is added in the form of iron sulphate or as chelates  
containing iron. The chelate form is often preferred since the  
iron remains in solution and is relatively available over a  
wide pH range. The most popular compound is EDTA, but  
use of this molecule may be restricted or prohibited in some  
countries because it does not break down in the environment,  
and has the potential to contaminate natural waters. Zinc levels  
are critical (below 0.25 ppm can cause deficiency and above 1  
ppm  can cause  
  
toxicity).  
Suitable systems  
Pepinos have been grown successfully in gravel and sand  
culture. This fruit may have some commercial potential,  
although as yet it has not seriously been tested in  
hydroponics.  
Planting  
Plant pepinos at 0.5 to 0. 8 metre intervals. They grow  
readily from cuttings or natural layers.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis is essential. Stems must be tied up or they will  
sprout roots wherever they come in contact with moist  
media. This self - layering leads to a reduct ion in fruit  
production.  
Problems  
Avoid severe cold or heat.  
White f ly and various other pests and diseases that affect  
tomatoes can occur.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest pepinos when the fruit turns yellow. They keep  
well in cool conditions, althoug h cold temperatures can  
damage fruit.  
 
Pineapple Ananas comosus Bromeliaceae  
Growing conditions  
Day temperatures are best not exceeding 31°C. Once  
fruits begin to mature, night temperatures should not  
drop below 21°C. Dry air environment, and moist, well - drained, well -aerated root environment. It will survive  
reduced watering but fruit production decreases.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.5 to 6.0. Hig h levels of nitrogen and potassium are  
important early in the crop.  
Iron and zinc are particularly important minor nutrients.  
Suitable systems  
Sholto Douglas reports good results growing pineapples in  
hydroponics. Aggregate culture is most likely to succ eed.  
Planting  
Plant pineapple crowns (i.e. the leafy top cut directly  
from the fruit) directly into sand/perlite or  
vermiculite/perlite, in a permanent position.  
 
 
Special cultural techniques  
After harvest, side shoots or suckers develop which produce  
a second crop about a year later. This second crop is not as  
good as the first. Remove and replant after the second crop.  
Problems  
Mealy bug can cause problems when growing pineapples. Several  
fungal problems may arise, including rots caused by  
Phytophth ora species.  
Harvest and post harvest  
The first harvest is up to two years after planting.  
Raspberry (Red) Rubus idaeus Rosaceae  
Raspberries are well suited to hydroponic greenhouse  
production as cane height can be controlled and there are a  
number of cultivars that produce early and late season crops.  Out of season production is also possible making this a high  
value crop for many areas.  
Growing Conditions  
Pre chilled canes plante d out in a greenhouse need  
temperatures in the range 10 - 12º C for the first 2 weeks,  
thereafter raised to a minimum of 12º C up to 24º C.  
Temperatures above 30º C cause growth and fruiting  
problems. Air movement is essential to eliminate areas of  
high humidity that cause fungal infection of canes and fruit.  
Good light levels or supplementary lighting are required for  
the production of out of season fruit in winter in many areas.  
Nutrient requirements  
Raspberries need high level of potassium (K) to m aintain fruit  
quality and f lavour and sufficient calcium (Ca) to assist with  
firmness and maintaining a long shelf life. pH levels in the  
range  
5.8- 6.0 are advised.  
Suitable systems  
Both media and NFT systems can be used for raspberries. Media  
grown plants need a free draining substrate such as sand, pear,  
perlite or vermiculite. Container grown plants need a  
minimum of 20 litres for second year f loricane types. First year  
primocane types can be grown in 6 litre containers. NFT  
grown plants need to have a wide diameter channel and  
solution warming can be used for winter production.  
Special culture techniques  
Systems of production vary. Dormant canes can be selected from  
field grown crops for lifting with some root structure int act. The  
canes must be strong and 1 - 1.5 m in length with a number of  buds. Dormant raspberry canes need a good reserve of  
carbohydrates to support the first f lush of new growth when  
planted into the greenhouse. Dormant canes need to be  
wrapped in pl astic and placed in cold storage at 4ºC for 6  
weeks. After this time canes can be transplanted into a warm  
greenhouse and hydroponic system for crop production. Once  
the canopy has developed to a sufficient size the canes are  
tipped so that fruit devel opment is favoured. There are 2  
main types of raspberry plant - those that fruit on first year  
shoots called `primocane varieties -  and those which fruit on  
second year wood, termed `f loricane -  types. Floricane types  
produce fruit in early summer, but  can be manipulated to  
 
 
fruit in winter under protected cultivation and are more  
suited to hydroponic production.  
Flowering will begin on canes around 6 - 8 weeks from  
planting out from cold storage. Flowers require good  
pollination for fruit set, size and shape. Bumble bees are  
often introduced into greenhouses for this purpose.  
Raspberry plants can pollinate without the presence of  
pollinators in the greenhouse, but this reduces the number  
of fruit and can affect fruit shape.  
Problems  
It is important to select raspberry stock from plants certified  
to be free of viruses, pests and diseases. Rust and Botrytis  
are the main diseases of greenhouse raspberries, along  
with Phytophthora root rot under waterlogged conditions.  
Pests include t he raspberry aphid, which can spread  raspberry viruses diseases, as well as thrips, mites and  
whitefly. Incorrect temperatures or lack of chilling will  
result in bud break failure, lack of f lowers and low yields.  
Lack of pollination will result in sma ller berries, berry  
drop and fruits than crumble after harvest.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Hydroponic yields of 4 times the average of soil grown crops  
have been reported with the percentage of unmarketable  
berries being considerably lower. Fruit is hand harvested to  
reduce damage and bruising and packaged into small (200 g)  
punnets, individually wrapped and labelled for shipment.  
Storage is under refrigeration at 2 - 4º C, although shelf  
life is limited to 6 - 8 days in most cases.  
Varieties  
Varieties v ary depending on what planting stock is  
available locally from outdoor plantings.  
Redcurrant Ribes sativum  
Rosaceae As for blackcurrant.  
Strawberry Fragaria ananassa Rosaceae  
Strawberries are very well suited to hydroponic growing  
and they offer a quick  return on capital outlays for the  
grower.  
Growing conditions  
Strawberries require good drainage and aeration. They need  
reasonable ventilation (air movement) around foliage  
and fruit. A good quality water supply (with a low level  
of dissolved salts) is critical.  
In summer, plantings require approximately 20 litres of  
water per square metre for good vegetative growth in sand  culture. The Ideal temperature for good vegetativ e growth is  
15°C to 18°C. Low temperatures over winter are required  
to break the dormancy which develops in autumn and  
higher temperatures are required for good crop  
development.  
Nutrient requirements  
Strawberries require a pH of 6.0 (a high pH will ca use iron  
deficiency). Sulphur, boron and magnesium are important  
minor nutrients. A lack of boron can result in poor  
pollination. Potassium or magnesium deficiencies can  
cause leaf burn. Potassium deficiency may also cause  
insipid and soft fruit. Keep  the level of chlorine present to a  
minimum. Phosphorus level should be higher  
 
 
than in that used in the average nutrient mix.  
Suitable systems  
Many commercial strawberry hydroponic systems are based on a  
trough system. Troughs, filled with gravel, perl ite or granulated  
rockwool, are typically 10 -15 cm x 15 -20cm, with four or five  
troughs mounted vertically.  
Strawberries can also be produced using the hanging bag  
system. In this system, a bag made of black irrigation f luming is  
hung from a frame. The - bag-  is usually 900 -1200mm long and  
150mm in diameter. It is filled with a growth medium, and  
nutrients are fed in at the top and run to waste at the bottom.  
The strawberries are planted in holes in the side of the bag.  
Whilst  this is an inexpensive system to set up, many growers do  
not fully understand the technique and fail to produce good  crops.  
Planting  
Plants are spaced at 35 -40 cm intervals.  
Runners are removed from parent plants in mid to late  
summer and stored betwee n 0°C and -2°C until ready for  
planting. Only use material which is free of virus. New  
varieties are propagated in tissue culture.  
Put in any new plants in early autumn. Trim the roots to  
around 8 cm when planting. Runners which have been  
established i n pots may also be used as planting material. Any  
f lowers with runners are removed at planting time to prevent  
premature fruit formation.  
Early plantings (late autumn) can give up to double the crop  
in their first season compared with late plantings (l ate  
winter).  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove runners which develop on plants as they will  
detract from the quantity and quality of the crop (ie. only retain  
the main plant). Cut old leaves off at the end of each season - s  
harvest (late autumn), leav ing only emerging new foliage.  
Replant every three to four years, (after that time, virus  
disease is highly likely to be affecting production, even if plants  
still look healthy).  
Some types of granulated media (eg. perlite and vermiculite) will  
adhere to the fruit. Laying a plastic mulch on the surface of such  
media will keep the fruit clean.  
 
 
Problems  Viruses transmitted by aphis are a major problem.  
Snails, slugs, birds and va rious grubs will attack fruit at  
times. Fungal diseases such as botrytis can also affect fruit,  
particularly under humid conditions.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest fruit as it changes to red on a daily basis.  
Strawberries are ready to pick when the co lour has  
changed 60 -70% pink, and the rest of the fruit is still  
white. Pick the fruit with the stalk still attached and place  
immediately in a cool place (10 -15°C). Strawberries  
harvested at this stage and stored at 2°C will keep for up  
to 10 days.  
Flavour is best on berries harvested when fully red, but the  
storage period is greatly reduced.  
Vanilla - Vanilla Planifolia Orchidaceae  
Vanilla is a relatively new hydroponic crop being produced  
in greenhouses in climates such as Hawaii. Vanilla is an  
orchid with long, trailing stems which need support as they  
climb upwards reaching a length in excess of 10 meters.  
Stems are often tied to wooden stakes to replicate their  
natural habit of climbing trees. Access to the upper stems  
is required for hand p ollination of the f lowers which is  
necessary for bean pod production. Flowers only open  
briefly and must be pollinated within a day by hand  
which creates a large labour requirement for this crop.  
Plants are grown in beds of free draining, coarse media  
such as volcanic pumice or scoria mixed with fibrous  
material such as coco peat. Nutrient solution is drip irrigated  
as required to support the rapid growth rate of the plant  under tropical or sub tropical conditions. Protected  
cultivation produces higher yields and good quality pods  
which are harvested before they are fully ripe and cured to  
develop their aroma and f lavour.

 CHAPTER 14 : FLOWER CROPS   
 
 
 
Alstroemeria (Peruvian Lily) Alstroemeriaceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires good drainage and constant moisture.  
Four weeks or more at 5°C or lower is required over winter  
to initiate flower buds.  
As day length increases, f lowering starts and continues  
while temperatures remain below 18°C.  
Nutrient requirements  
Suggested NPK ratio 15:1:9.  
Only apply nitrogen in ni trate form.  
Suitable systems  
Recommended for sand or perlite culture in beds, foam boxes  
or plastic bags.  
Planting  
Propagated by division of rhizomes.  
Special cultural techniques  
Grow through a horizontal trellis.  
Problems  
Relatively free of pests and diseases.  
White f ly, caterpillars and aphis can occur under warm  conditions. Regular applications of fungicide and insecticide are  
used when grown commercially under glass.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest by pulling off ste ms (this stimulates further f  
lowering). Harvest when first f lowers are opening and strip  
lower leaves from stem before placing in water in a cool position.  
Amaryllis (Hippeastrum) Amaryllidaceae  
Amaryllis is grown commercially both as a cut f lower and  for  
bulb production.  
Growing conditions  
Minimum root temperature of 20°C.  
High humidity is preferable.  
Root zone must have constant moisture but be reasonably  
well aerated.  
Night air temperature should not drop below 18°C.  
Carbon dioxide enrichment has  been used in some greenhouses  
in Europe to maximise growth.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nutrient requirement is low in early stages but should be  
increased as the crop develops.  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture is probably most appropriate.  
Sand and sand/perlite have been used most successfully.  
Planting  
Propagate from offsets or scale cuttings.  
Plant out in beds mid to late winter. Spacing will relate to  
the size of the bulbs being planted.  Special cultural techniques  
Ventilation can be important, but shading is only ever used  
in extreme situations.  
Horizontal mesh trellis is important, among other  
reasons, to control fungal diseases by improving air  
movement around the plant.  
Problems  
Pests  include mites, thrip and aphis.  
Several fungal diseases including fusarium, as well as virus,  
can occur.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Lift bulbs late autumn and dry quickly at 23°C before  
marketing or storing for replanting.  
Harvest f lowers when buds becom e loose, but before they  
open. Store at 7 -10°C.  
 
 
Anigozanthus (Kangaroo Paw) Haemodoraceae  
Kangaroo Paw is a popular cut f lower. Perhaps the greatest  
limiting factor is ink spot fungal disease, which is difficult to  
control in most soil plantings. Hyd roponic culture may offer a  
way of overcoming this disease.  
Growing conditions  
Needs a well -drained and aerated root zone.  
Requires low humidity.  
Optimum day temperatures are between 18 and 27°C.  
Requires a sunny position.  
There is considerable variation in specific climatic  
preferences between varieties.  Nutrient requirements  
Unknown in detail.  
Iron is important, phosphorus should not be too high.  
Suitable systems  
Gravel, sand or rockwool are suggested.  
Planting  
Propagate by division or tissue culture. Seedlings are  
variable. Spacing depends on variety.  
Problems  
Main problem is ink spot fungal disease which is very  
difficult to control.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest continually over warm months when first f lowers  
open on a stem.  
Varieties  
A range of hybrid varieties under the name - Bush Gems -   
is relatively resistant to ink spot.  
 
Antirrhinum (Snapdragon) Scrophulariaceae  
Growing conditions  
Cool greenhouse crop, a perennial usually treated as an annual,  
providing c ut f lowers mainly in winter and spring.  
For winter -flowering varieties, temperatures in the range of 10°C  
(night) to 16°C (day) are best. For spring varieties, 16 -22°C,  
and for summer types 18 -24°C.  
For the first 4 -6 weeks of growth all types respond well to a night  
temperature of 16°C.  
Nutrient requirements  
Requires high calcium.  pH 6.5  
Sensitive to high EC levels.  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Gravel and sand culture have been very successful.  
Modified NFT ( with coarse sand in the channels) should  
succeed. Rockwool should succeed.  
Planting  
Sow seed in a container of san, or peat and sand and  
transplant when small (approximately one month after  
sowing) with a ball of medium around the roots to their  
perman ent position, with a spacing of around 20 cm x 20 cm.  
Special cultural techniques  
Pinch growing tip out at 6 -8 cm to encourage branching.  
Problems  
Seed is very fine so sub -irrigation is best for watering at this stage.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Flowers are cut when the bottom f lorets are completely  
expanded, while the tip f lorets are in tight bud.  
The cut stems should be put immediately into water and  
ideally stored at an air temperature of 4°C.  
 
 
Aster Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
An annual producing f lowers in summer and autumn.  
Some shade in hot weather is beneficial.  
Night temperatures above 23°C result in weaker stems and  smaller f lower heads.  
Constant rate of growth is important to achieve good crops.  
Avoid rapid temperatu re changes.  
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeders.  
Require high levels of  
calcium. pH 6.0 to 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Few references available specific to hydroponic growing.  
We suggest rockwool and gravel culture would be appropriate.  
Planting  
Grown from seed  then transplanted when small either bare - 
rooted or with ball of germination medium around roots.  
Spacing depends on variety, but generally around 20 cm x 20 cm.  
Optimum germination temperature is 21°C.  
Special cultural techniques  
Each shoot from the mai n stem is disbudded to a single f  
lower. Remove any suckers which develop.  
Grow through one or two layers of horizontal trellis (15 cm  
mesh). Artificial lighting is sometimes used to extend day length  
and stimulate flowering.  
Problems  
Pests include slug s, snails, aphis.  
Diseases include anthracnose, botrytis, fusarium and verticillium  
wilt, powdery and downy mildew, and viral diseases.  
A regular spray program is necessary, particularly to control  
aphis and botrytis. Be careful to follow spray recommendations  
as aster foliage is susceptible to chemical spray burn.  
Harvest and post harvest  Cut when outside petals are fully open but some inside petals  
are still folded and retain a slight tinge of green.  
Strip leaves from bottom one -third of stem, bunch and stand in  
water, ideally in a cool room at 5 -8°C. 
 
 
Begonia Begoniaceae  
Growing conditions  
Does not tolerate intense light  
conditions . Requires shading in warm  
or mild climates.  
Air temperature is best between 21°C and 27°C.  
The root environment should be more moist than  
average, but well drained. (At lower temperatures, root  
environment needs to be drier.)  
While some types will surv ive at tow temperatures, all are  
frost tender.  
Nutrient requirements  
Has low iron, high potassium  
requirements. pH 6.5  
Suitable systems  
Capillary -fed aggregate systems are excellent.  
Has been grown very successfully in perlite and 50/50  
perlite and sand.  
Planting  
Propagate by seed, leaf or stem cuttings.  
Problems  
Pests include aphis, scale, mealy bug.  
Diseases include botrytis, anthracnose, various root rot  fungi, verticillium wilt, powdery mildew, bacterial spot and  
crown gall.  
Harvest  and post harvest  
Several types grown and sold as container plants, notably  
tuberous begonias in full bloom.  
Canna Cannaceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires good drainage and aeration.  
Requires frequent irrigations and ample nutrient to  
maintain a fast growt h rate.  
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeders but nitrogen should be minimised to prevent  
vegetative growth at the expense of f lowers.  
pH 6.0  
Suitable systems  
Has been successful in aggregate culture.  
Commercial application of cannas in hydroponics is doub tful. 
Planting  
Propagated by root division.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis and wind protection are needed.  
Problems  
Very few major problems.  
 
 
Carnation Dianthus sp. Caryophyllaceae  
Growing conditions  
Good aeration and drainage are critical for optimum cropping.  
Optimum temperature for disbuds (or Sims) is 15 -18°C,  and preferably not over 22°C.  
Optimum temperature for spray (bunching) carnations is up  
to 6°C higher in summer and 3°C higher in winter.  
Will tolerate almost any freezing temperatures.  
Flowering is initiated by both mild to warm temperature and  
medium to long days. You need both a good day length and  
adequate temperatures.  
Water requirement can be up to eight times as much in mid -  
summe r compared to mid -winter.  
Avoid high humidity.  
Nutrient requirements  
EC should never exceed 3.5 mS/cm; ideally keep at 2.0  
mS/cm. pH should be around 6.0.  
Nutrient solution should be approximately as follows:  
 
NUTRIENT  
PPM  
Nitrogen  
170 
Iron 
1.2 
Phosphorus  
50 
Manganese  
0.4 
Potassium  
245 
Copper  
0.4 Calcium  
160 
Zinc 
0.2 
Magnesium  
25 
Boron  
0.2 
Molybdenum  
0.05  
Sulphur should not exceed 32 ppm.  
Nitrogen should be supplied as nitrate, not as an ammonium salt.  
While plants are becoming established, nitrogen and calcium  
requirements are high, but during f lowering calcium  
requirement decreases. Up to 30 kg/1000 litre of additional  
calcium nitrat e may be added to the standard nutrient over the  
first few months and gradually be reduced as the plants establish.  
Established plants should be fed with the standard solution.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool has been used commercially in the Netherlands since   
1978.  
Rockwool slabs between 10 and 12 cm deep are more  
successful than shallower slabs. Six to eight drippers should be  
supplied per square metre of rockwool slab. Set slabs on  
plastic sheet base with a slight slope for sub -drainage. Plastic  
sheet can lead to reduced  
 
 
humidity in a greenhouse -  in some instances this needs to  be countered with routine overhead misting.  
Perlite 8 -10 cm deep gives excellent results.  
Scoria has  given good results.  
Planting  
Use virus -tested cuttings from approved carnation growers.  
These may be supplied in Growool blocks or perlite tubes.  
(If in soil - based medium this must be washed off before  
planting.) Disbudded carnations (eg. Sims) are pl anted at 30 - 
36 plants per square metre.  
Spray carnations are commonly planted at 36 -48 plants per  
square metre. A wider spacing improves ventilation and reduces  
likelihood of disease.  
Cropping starts around three months after planting.  
Special cultural techniques  
Open horizontal mesh 15 -20 cm above the medium provides a  
support system.  
Pruning is necessary to stop spindly undesirable growth habits.  
Pinch out the growing tip on young plants when they reach  
about 15 cm tall.  
Artificial lighting is somet imes used to concentrate the f lowering  
period (ie. you get more f lower over a shorter period, but after  
that f lowering is delayed until the next crop). This is done by  
lighting at 110 lux from dust till dawn for four weeks, usually  
in mid -winter.  
Problems  
Hygiene is very important for disease control and  
consequently crop quality.  
Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum) spreads rapidly through  
irrigation.  Botrytis is sometimes a problem.  
Alternaria leaf spot occurs as small purple spots  which grow to  
larger black areas bearing spores.  
Viral diseases, mainly transmitted by aphids, are a particularly  
serious problem, reducing cropping in many parts of the world. It  
is critical to plant only virus -free plants, and to control aphis to  
prevent healthy plants from becoming infected.  
Do not get flower buds or petals wet as this can cause marking.  
Flowers which develop at lower temperatures have a tendency to  
split. Flowers developing at higher temperatures develop faster  
and tend to have weaker stems.  
Aphis and mites can be very serious pests. Aphis spread virus  
and cause distorted growth. Mites cause mottling of the leaves  
and eventually drying of the foliage.  
Thrip and caterpillars can also become a problem.  
 
 
Harvest and post harvest  
For single -flowering varieties the f lowers are harvested  
when the bud has opened fully so that the outer petals  
are at right angles to the stem and the inner petals are  
still tightly bunched.  
For spray types harvesting occurs when the top three f  
lowers begin expanding and the lower buds are showing  
colour.  
One part boric acid in ten parts water will improve the  
keeping quality of the f lowers by up to one week.  
Dipping treatments, based on sodium thiosulphate, that  
extend the keeping quality of  the f lowers are also  available.  
Harvested f lowers can be damaged by ethylene. An  
ethylene - inhibiting chemical is used on f lowers which are  
not sold as soon as they are picked.  
 
 
Chrysanthemum Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires very good drainag e, good aeration and constant  
moisture in the root zone.  
Plants are frost tender.  
Needs good light, though shading is sometimes used over  
summer to provide protection from extreme heat.  
Buds do not form if the period of uninterrupted darkness  
exceeds 7 hours.  
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeders.  
High nitrogen is important in the early stages.  
Adequate phosphorus is critical at all stages.  
Iron deficiency is more likely in poorly -aerated root zones.  
If roots are too wet, high levels of potassium, sodium or  
nitrogen in the ammonium form will impair the uptake of  
magnesium, calcium and sulphur.  
pH ideally 6.0 to 6.2.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture has been very successful in sand or perlite.  
Planting  
Start cuttings in sand, vermiculite or rockwool propagating  
blocks.  Spacing is dependent on variety, with larger varieties spaced  
up to 70 cm apart.  
Special cultural techniques  
Pinch  out growing tips to cause lateral growths.  
Problems  
Pests include aphis, mites, whitefly, leaf miners and  
caterpillars.  
Diseases include verticillium wilt, sclerotinia wilt, septoria  
leaf spot, powdery mildew, botrytis and virus.  
Harvest and post harves t 
Flowers are harvested when the outer petals have opened, but  
the inner ones are still expanding.  
Sprays are harvested when three or more f lowers reach this  
stage. The base of the f lower stems should be dipped in boiling  
water for 30 seconds, then pl aced in buckets of water containing  
disinfectant such as sodium or calcium hypochlorite.  
Flowers protected by a pre -harvest fungicide treatment can  
be cool stored for up to two weeks at 2 -3°C as long as the f lowers  
are dry and the stems are kept in wat er. 
Dahlia Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Requires better than average moisture when growing fast,  
with good aeration and drainage.  
Plants are frost sensitive.  
Optimum temperature range is 16 -19°C.  
Nutrient requirements  
 
 
Potassium and phosphorus  important. pH 6.0 to 7.0.  
Suitable  
systems  
Aggregate  
culture.  
Planting  
Propagate by cuttings or division.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellising and wind protection are needed.  
Problems  
Mildew is more common in hydroponics tha n soil  
(plants being more susceptible when growth is very rapid).  
Harvest and post harvest  
Pick as buds just begin to burst open.  
Freesia Iridaceae  
Growing conditions  
Corms require 16°C day temperatures (or higher) to  
commence growing. Once six leaves ha ve formed f lowers  
will begin to develop, and at this stage ideal temperature  
is 13°C -  over 18°C f lowering is reduced. After this point,  
temperatures between 12°C and 20°C give optimum growth.  
Nutrient requirements  
1.0 mS/cm for the first two months then increasing to 2.0  
mS/cm. pH 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool has been successful in Europe.  
Aggregate culture in beds should be  
successful.  
Planting  Plant corms in autumn for spring f lowering.  
Special cultural techniques  
A horizontal trellis for support is necessary.  
Problems  
Diseases include fusarium wilt, botrytis and virus.  
Aphis is perhaps the most serious pest problem because it  
spreads viral disease.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Cut f lowers when first bud is starting t o open.  
Harvesting starts within 10 to 12 weeks of  
planting. Bunch and store at 2 -4°C. 
Gerbera Asteraceae  
Growing conditions  
Root aeration is extremely critical.  
 
 
It is important to maintain active growth over winter to  
achieve good cropping in the seco nd year.  
At temperatures over 18°C the plants are evergreen, but  
below 18°C they die back to a dormant root system.  
Commercially they are cropped in heated  
greenhouses. They have a high light requirement.  
Nutrient requirements  
Maintain young plants on an EC of 2.0 mS/cm and gradually  
increase to 2.5 mS/cm as plants establish.  
pH between 5.0 and 6.5.  
pH can drop when plants are producing heavily -  if this  
happens, f lush the slab to remove any salt build -up and  
correct the pH . pH tends to rise in early spring when there is a lot of leaf  
growth. Nutrient solution as follows:

Sulphur should be no higher than 40.  
Suitable systems  Growool slabs are used commercially in Europe.  
Aggregate culture should also be commercially  
viable.  
Planting  
Plants are grown for two seasons then discarded.  
Propagate b y division.  
Space 25 -30 cm between plants.  
Special cultural techniques  
Horizontal trellis is needed.  
Remove one leaf each time you move a f lower to maintain  
balance between f lower and leaf growth. At the end of winter  
remove all dead or damaged leaves and f lower stems.  
Problems  
A sunny period followed by dull humid weather in summer can  
cause water problems with the plants losing water at an  
excessively  
 
 
high rate and requiring extra irrigations, both day and  
night. Pest problems include caterpilla rs, mites, leaf  
hoppers, mealy bug and other insects.  
Disease problems include botrytis, powdery mildew and  
some blight and rot -causing fungi.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Flowers must be reasonably mature with stamens in the  
second ring of disc f lowers visible before picking. Pull off f  
lower stalks rather than cutting. Put in a bucket of warm  
nutrient solution immediately they are picked.  
Varieties  Different varieties have different water requirements.  
Gladiolus Iridaceae  
Growing conditions  
Gladioli grow from a corm. Leaves and roots emerge  
from the corm in late winter or spring and develop into  
a plant. The old corm is totally absorbed by the growth, but  
a new corm forms with many smaller cormlets attached to  
its bottom. At the end of the growing season, the leaves  
and roots die back, leaving only the corm and cormlets  
alive. The corm and cormlets will not regrow until they  
have undergone a period of dormancy. Ov er this period, they  
are susceptible to rooting and hence need to be stored dry.  
Either remove dormant corms from a hydroponic system or  
leave the system dry for a period before attempting to  
start growing a new crop.  
Corms formed when the root zone te mperature are  
above 15°C are more dormant than those that mature  
when temperatures are cooler. Dormancy has been broken  
by storage at 5°C for two months followed by storage at  
20°C.  
Adequate light is needed to produce f lowers. If light  
intensity is t oo low or day lengths too short, f lowers will  
not occur.  
Aeration is not as critical as with some crops, though  
good drainage is essential, particularly for early or late  
crops.  
High humidity around the developing spike can cause fungal  
diseases and damaged f lowers, though this risk is minimal  
as the flowers are generally picked before opening.  Drier conditions can increase the likelihood of foliage insect  
problems.  
Drier cond itions cause earlier f lowering.  
Nutrient requirements  
The most common nutrient deficiencies are iron,  
boron and copper.  
Iron deficiency is indicated by loss of colour between  
the leaf veins.  
Boron deficiency may be indicated by leaves cracking horizonta lly 
. 
Copper deficiency may be indicated by leaves wilting  
for no apparent reason.  
Nitrogen supplied in the ammonium form increases  
susceptibility to the fungus Botrytis gladiolorum.  
Nutrient solutions should preferably supply nitrogen in the  
nitrate fo rm. 
Potash and phosphorus are important.  
Because the f lower and new corm commence development  
only three to four weeks after planting, it is important  
to provide a strong supply of nutrients early in the  
growth cycle.  
 
 
pH should be maintained between 5.5 and 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool and NFT are not suitable for gladioli.  
Aggregate culture is the most suitable technique as it is the only  
system which provides an appropriate depth and allows  
corms to be lifted easi ly for dormant storage at the end of each  growing season.  
Planting  
Plant at a depth of 10 cm.  
Special cultural techniques  
Some form of trellising is required (either a horizontal mesh, or  
wires around a row at about 30 cm height).  
Problems  
Wet, cold cond itions promote several diseases including  
stromatinia, botrytis and septoria.  
In warm conditions gladioli are susceptible to the fungus  
Fusarium oxysporum which attack both the foliage and the  
corm.  
Viral diseases spread by aphis are one of the most ser ious disease  
problems.  
Viral infection is indicated by discolouration or blotching of  
foliage or f lowers. Infected plants cannot be cured and must be  
removed and burnt to prevent further spread of the disease.  
Thrips can be a serious problem in warm we ather (above 20°C),  
causing silvery streaks on the foliage and subsequent decline  
in the plant.  
Mites, caterpillars and a number of other insects can also be a  
problem.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Usually pick between 70 and 140 days from planting.  
Harvest when the bottom two to four f lowers on a stem are  
showing colour. Place in water as soon as picked and store  
in a cool room between 5°C and 7°C.  
 
 Gypsophila Caryophyllaceae  
Growing conditions  
Can be grown outdoors but needs shelter from hot, dry wind  
and rain during f lowering.  
Needs good light for f lowering.  
Requires good drainage.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.0 -  7.5. 
EC is maintained at 2 mS/cm in winter and 1.6 mS/cm in  
summer.  
Suitable systems  
Rockwool is used successfully for commercial production.  
Planting  
The perennial Gypsophila paniculata is cropped for two to  
three years.  
Propagated by tissue culture or tip cuttings.  
Cuttings should be taken before f lower initiation occurs, at th e 6- 
8 leaf stage. Cuttings are difficult to strike when taken from stock  
growing in cool, low light conditions.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove the main central lateral to promote uniform growth  
on remaining shoots. Pinch the shoot at the fifth to se venth  
node.  
Supplementary lighting and heating are needed for year - 
round production.  
A trellis is needed to support the stems.  
Problems  
Flowering stops when daylength and temperatures decrease, at  
which time the crowns rosette.  Harvest  
Harvest when 50% of the f lowers on a stem are open.  
Store in a high humidity cool room.  
Varieties  
Gypsophila paniculata - Bristol Fairy -  is the most com monly grown  
commercial variety.  
Newer cultivars are - Bridal Veil -  and the Danziger cultivars  
from Israel.  
Iris Iridaceae  
Growing conditions  
In high humidity, plant rhizomes or bulbs close to the surface  
of the media. In hot dry air conditions, plant deeper (2 -5 cm  
below the surface).  
Nutrient requirements  
Little specific information available for hydroponics.  
 
 
Suitable systems  
Depends on the type of iris. Some types require very little  
aeration and will grow completely submerged in water,  
others d o not.  
Iris laevigata needs to be in extremely we conditions to  
thrive. It would be best suited to water culture or perhaps  
tried in a medium such as 40% vermiculite and 60% perlite.  
Iris germanica requires a very well aerated situation.  
The author has grown these successfully with minimal  
irrigations.  
Dutch, Spanish and English irises generally like a drier,  
better - drained medium than average. These would be  best tried in sand or  gravel beds.  
Planting  
Plant bulbs or rhizomes direct into hydroponics.  
Special cultural techniques  
Some support system is necessary.  
Problems  
Overwatering will cause bulb or rhizome rot.  
Pest and disease problems include snails and slugs, aphis,  
thrip, b ulb f lies, viral diseases, leaf spot, ink spot and iris  
rusts.  
Frost can be a problem with some types.  
Harvest  
Cut when f lower begins to appear in the f lower.  
Varieties  
Irises are classified as follows:  
1. Bulbous types  
a) Xiphiums (Dutch, Spanish, Eng lish) 
These are popular as cut f lowers worldwide.  
b) Early f lowering and small Reticulatas  
c) Junos varieties  
2. Rhizome types  
a) Bearded  
Have f leshy rhizomes and large wide bladed  
leaves. These generally prefer warm, dry  
conditions.  
b) Beardless  
Narrower leaves and smaller fibrous rhizomes.  
These prefer wet situations.  
c) Crested  Thin rhizomes.  
 
 
Lisianthus Gentianaceae  
Growing conditions  
Optimum temperatures are above 16°C and bel ow  
25°C. Good drainage is essential.  
Long days promote f lowering.  
Most commercial production is in greenhouses, although  
open field production is possible in warmer areas. Some  
protection from heavy rain is beneficial.  
Shading is highly beneficial.  
Supplementary lighting (4500 lux minimum) and heating is  
required in most areas for winter production.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.3 -  7.0. 
Lisianthus prefer high levels of calcium and adequate  
phosphorus. 1 -1.2mS/cm in summer and 1.5 -1.6mS/cm in  
winter.  
Suitable systems  
Has been grown successfully in fine sand mixed with rice  
hulls. Coarse, free -draining bark or cocopeat may be suitable.  
Planting  
Propagated from seeds. High temperatures during  
propagation cause rosetting (clustering of leaves and short  
internodes on the stem).  
Problems  
Root diseases, especially pythium, can be a significant problem.  
Outdoor crops in areas with heavy summer rain are very  prone to root rots.  
Leaf diseases that may need spraying include downy mildew and  
botrytis.  
Thrips can be a problem.  
Harvest  
Plants are usually cropped twice. The first f lowers are picked at  
around 12 weeks, with a second crop picked 7 -8 weeks later.  
After the second crop the plants begin t o lose vigour.  
Place f lowers immediately into a coolroom.  
Narcissus (Daffodil, Jonquil) Amaryllidaceae  
Growing conditions  
Require cool conditions with daily maximums not over 21°C and  
preferably not over 18°C. Higher temperatures may be tolerated  
at the  end of the growth cycle.  
Nutrient requirements  
High light intensities can increase iron requirement.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture is suggested as having the best potential.  
Narcissus have been grown successfully in 40% perlite and 60%  
coarse grani tic sand.  
 
 
Planting  
Plant at a depth equal to three times the bulb - s thickness.  
Special cultural  
techniques Horizontal  
trellis support.  
Problems  
Pest and disease problems can include mites, bulb f lies,  slugs, viruses, and various fungal rots and leaf -marking  
diseases.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest any time from when colour appears in the swollen f  
lower bud (just before or immediately after the f lower  
opens).  
 
Orchids Orchidaceae  
Orchids are a very large group of plants which vary greatly  
in appearance and growth requirements. Cymbidiums are  
the only orchids we know of which have been grown  
commercially in hydroponics.  
Growing conditions  
Must have excellent aeration and perfect drainage..  
Cymbidiums require temperatures between 15°C and  
25°C, and full light for good growth when young.  
Minimum temperature for cymbidiums should be 10°C.  
Flowers are initiated during a period of 21°C day  
temperatures and 14°C night temperatures over summer.  
Good ventilation (air movement) around plants is  
important. Some types have a semi -dormant period  
of growth (eg. dendrobiums) while others, if given  
optimum conditions, will grow continuously (eg.  
cymbidiums).  
Nutrient requirements  
pH should be around 5.5 for cymbidiums.  
Some nitrogen is supplied as ammonium salt to help kept  
the pH low.  
Keep solution at low concentrations of around 0.8 mS/cm or  lower. Sodium and chloride levels must be kept low.  
Sulphate content is kept low to stop EC from going too high.  
Suitable systems  
Traditionally cymbidiums have been grow in peat -based  
mixes. In Europe there has been increased use of  
granular rockwool.  
Only rockwool or material with no cation exchange  
capacity should be used, to minimise salt build -up (see  
below).  
Planting  
Grow in individual containers fed by drippers.  
As the plants grow in size, the container size and spacing can  
be increased. Three -year -old plants in 10 -litre containers  
are spaced at 8 plants per square metre; five -year -old plants  
in 20 -litre containers are spaced at 3 plants per square  
metre.  
 
 
Problems  
Be careful to remove all peat or bark from the roots when  
transplanting into hydroponics. Residues of such material in a  
hydropon ic medium can attract deposits of salts from nutrient  
solution. This build -up can eventually reach toxic levels and  
damage the plant.  
Various pests and diseases occur and need to be controlled,  
including root rots, viruses, mealy bug and aphis.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest before buds are fully opened.  
Cymbidiums will yield up to 90 blooms per square meter per  year at five years of  age in a good operation.  
 
Rose Rosa sp. Rosaceae  
Growing conditions  
Good aeration and drainage are vital.  
Light intensity must be good, but excessive hot sun will cause  
scorching.  
Ideal temperatures are 15 -27°C.  
Ventilation may be necessary to avoid exce edingly high humidity.  
Roses tolerate a very wide range of temperatures and have been  
grown successfully out of doors from the tropics to some of the  
coldest temperate regions.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.5 to 6.  
EC around 1.5 mS/cm (roses do not tolerat e high salt  
levels). A suitable nutrient solution would be as follows:  
 
NUTRIENT  
PPM  
Nitrogen (as nitrate)  
160

In recent times are more concentrated nutrient solution has  
been used by some growers who claim better cropping  
at EC readings of up to 2.5 or higher.  
Avoid excessive salt build -up (run -to-waste systems need  
frequent irrigations to leach out excess unus ed salts).  
Suitable systems  
Perlite.  
Granulated rockwool.  
Rockwool slabs - the way drainage from the slabs is  
handled is a critical factor in achieving high  
productivity. 10 cm deep slabs have proven more  
successful than 7.5 cm depth.  
In Europe, slab heating is frequently used to achieve  
cropping though winter.  
An excess of nutrient solution is normally applied, aiming for  a run - off of 15%, or more if cond uctivity becomes too high.  
Over winter, irrigations may be gradually reduced to a  
level which barely keeps the roots moist while the plants are  
dormant. Irrigations should return to normal when new  
season - s growth starts.  
Planting  
Space plants at least  0.5 m  
apart. Only use budded or  
grafted plants.  
The plants are usually purchased as bare -rooted plants  
with roots wrapped in sawdust of moss. The best time to  
buy is early winter. Place orders with wholesale nurseries  
at least six months in advance t o be sure of quality  
plants and the desired varieties.  
Special cultural techniques  
Regular pruning is essential. Prune hard in cold climates  
and lightly in warm climates.  
Problems  
Several diseases including black spot, fusarium, pythium,  
rust, phytophth ora and viruses.  
N.B. Fongarid can cause leaf scorch.  
Aphis is the most significant pest problem.  
Other pests include chafer grubs (on roots), borers,  
scale, caterpillars, leaf miner, leaf hopper, thrip and red  
spider mite.  
Flower buds sometimes fail to open. Wet or shaded  
conditions are the most common causes.  
Purple to brownish spotting on foliage can be caused by  
either poor drainage or use of a co pper -based spray.  Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest swollen buds as colour shows through, before they  
burst open.  
In New Zealand, greenhouse roses grown on a 30 cm grid  
produce 20 blooms per year per plant (ie. approximately  
220 blooms per square metre).  
In Israel, with over six months of cropping, yields of 200  
blooms per year per square metre have been achieved.  
Varieties  
Hybrid  Tea  roses  are  the  most  commonly  used   
for  cut f lowers. Floribundas are also used for cut f lowers,  
but not to the same degree.  
 
 
Stock Matthiola incana Cruciferae  
Growing conditions  
Requires cool temperatures, preferably not over 24°C.  
Requires temperature below 16°C for f lowering to be  
induced.  
Tolerates reasonably moist (but not over -wet) conditions in  
both air and root environments.  
Grows well in either sun or light shade.  
Nutrient requirements  
Adequate calcium and potassium are important.  
pH 6.0 to 7.0.  
Suitable systems  
Relatively easy to grow in rockwool or most aggregate systems.  
Planting  
Sow seed direct or transplant seedlings started in vermiculite,  perlite or rockwool propagating blocks.  
Problems  
Aphis can become a problem on mature plants.  
Seedlings are susceptible  to fungal diseases if they become too wet.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Store at 10°C or a little lower after harvest.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 15 : OTHER CROPS   
 
 
 
INDOOR PLANTS  
African violet Saintpaulia sp. Gesneriaceae  
Growing conditions  
Minimum temperature of 15°C, a relatively even temperature  
with no cold draughts or other sudden temperature  
changes.  
Bright light (day length of 16 hours or more is needed  
for f lowering).  
Nutrient requirements  
Maintain a lower EC than many other plants.  
pH 6.0 to 7.0.  
Suitable systems  
Self watering pots with aggregate are very successful.  
50/50 sand and perlite, expanded clay and scoria have  
been successful.  
Planting  
Propagates readily from leaf cuttings in 40% perlite and  60% coarse granitic sand.  
Has potential to se ll as a f lowering container plant growing  
in a hydroponic pot.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove dead f lowers and older marked  
leaves. Do not allow water to get on the  
foliage.  
Problems  
Markings on leaves are commonly caused by adverse  
environmental  conditions; especially if strong sunlight hits a  
leaf with water on its surface.  
Fungal diseases include crown rot (occurs with overwatering),  
botrytis and powdery mildew (which occur when leaves are  
sprayed with mist).  
Pest problems include whitefly, mealy bug and mites.  
Anthurium Araceae  
Growing conditions  
Minimum temperature of 15°C, optimum growth is between  
18 and 21°C.  
Bright light is required in winter, but summer shading may be  
necessary.  
Humidity is important (misting helps in dry climates).  
Root zone temperature and moisture must be maintained at  
constant levels, hence a freely draining medium with good  
insulation properties is best.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.0 to 6.0.  
 
 Suitable systems  
Has been grown successfully in high quality peat. Perlite  
or mixtures of sand with vermiculite or perlite should be  
suitable in self watering pots. Be careful not to use a  
medium which becomes too wet though.  
Can be grown for commercial sale as a contai ner plant,  
or a cut f lower.  
Planting  
Propagated by division when temperatures are around 21°C.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove spent f lowers or damaged leaves.  
Problems  
Low humidity leads to poor f lowering, brown leaf tips  
and curled leaves.  
Low te mperature can cause yellowing of  
foliage. Pests can include mealy bug,  
aphis and scale.  
Fungal diseases can rot roots in over wet conditions.  
Harvest and post harvest  
If grown as a cut f lower, f lowers are cut when 75% open,  
stood in preservative solut ion and stored at 13°C. They will  
keep for up to four weeks with regular changes to the  
solution.  
 
 
Aphelandra Acanthaceae  
Growing conditions  
Minimum temperature of 12°C, a preferred temperature of 18°C,  
and high humidity, bright light but not direct sunlight, constant  moisture and good aeration.  
Nutrient requirements  
Heavy feeders.  
pH 5.0 to 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture in 50 -70% sand mixed with peat, vermiculite  
or perlite, or in pure perlite, expanded clay or scoria.  
Planting  
Propagate by 8 cm tip cuttings in late spring.  
Special cultural techniques  
Minimise watering at lower temperatures when growth slows  
to prevent root rots.  
Problems  
Pests include aphis and mealy bug.  
Bromeliads Bromeliaceae  
Growing conditions  
Most will tolerate temperatures as low as 9°C, some will  
tolerate much lower temperatures, but not frost.  
High temperatures (over 25°C) are required to initiate flower ing.  
Bright light is important, but not direct sunlight.  
Nutrient requirements  
Nutrient requirements are relatively  
low. pH 5.0 to 7.5.  
Suitable systems  
Most types of aggregate culture are successful.  
Planting  
Propagate from offset division.  
Special cultural techniques  
Remove dead f lowers and  leaves. Problems  
Bromeliads have few problems.  
 
 
Caladium Araceae  
Growing conditions  
Temperatures should never be below 15°C and  
preferably always above 21°C.  
Moderate  light requirement (no direct sunlight).  
High humidity, good drainage and even root zone temperature.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.0 to 7.5.  
Suitable systems  
Well -draining, well -insulated aggregate media such as  
perlite would probably be best.  
Planting  
Plan t tubers early spring.  
Propagate by removing developing tubers from parent plant.  
Special cultural techniques  
As foliage dies back in autumn, lift tuber, trim off  
foliage and roots and store at 15°C until early spring.  
Problems  
Several fungal and insect p roblems can occur. Many of these  
are more likely to become serious when the plant is  
weakened by adverse environmental conditions.  
Dieffenbachia Araceae  
Growing conditions  
Temperature never below 15°C, bright light in winter but  
partial shade in summer, high humidity and warmth are  essential for best results.  
Root environment should be constantly moist and well aerated.  
Nutrient requirements  
High nitrogen  
requirement. pH 5.0 to  
6.0. 
Suitable systems  
Aggregate and water culture have been successful.  
Planting  
Propagate by tip or stem cuttings.  
Problems  
Pests include scale and spider mites.  
Excess water can cause stems to rot or discolour.  
Cool temperatures or excess light c an cause yellowing of foliage.  
 
 
Dracaena Agavaceae  
Growing conditions  
Temperature preferably not below 13°C, ideally 18 -24°C.  
High humidity, light summer shading and constant moisture  
in the root zone are important.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.0 to 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Most types of aggregate culture should be successful. A heavier  
medium (eg. scoria or expanded clay) may be preferable to give  
better anchorage.  
Planting  
Propagate by stem cuttings.  Special cultural techniques  
Some form of support may be  needed, particularly in lightweight  
media.  
Problems  
Too much water or excessive cold are the main reasons for  
death. Several pests and diseases can occur.  
 
Ferns  
Growing conditions  
Ferns vary greatly in temperature requirements according  
to variety.  
Most grow well between 16°C and 21°C.  
Most respond well to moderate light (but not bright light),  
prefer high humidity and constant moisture in the root zone.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH requirement varies but most do well at 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Luwasa self -watering pots with expanded clay aggregate have  
been used successfully.  
Perlite and peat have been successful with many ferns.  
Special cultural techniques  
Many ferns are deciduous and their foliage will die back for  
a period of the year. These are more s usceptible to root rot fungi  
if kept too moist when devoid of foliage.  
Problems  
Many pest and disease problems occur, including scale,  
mealy bug, caterpillars, aphis and snails.  
 
 Ficus Moraceae  
Growing conditions  
While many are relatively cold tolerant, most are best  
kept at temperatures above 15°C.  
They have relatively low water requirements but  
prefer high humidity.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.0 to 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Best in a clay aggregate such as gravel, s coria or expanded clay.  
Planting  
Propagate by cuttings or layering.  
Problems  
Mites thrive in low humidity. Scale can also be a  
problem. Excess water can lead to fungal root  
and stem rots.  
 
 
Impatiens Balsaminaceae  
Growing conditions  
Bright light but not direct hot light in summer.  
Ideally temperatures around 24°C and preferably never  
below 12°C.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.5 to 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Most aggregate systems are suitable.  
Planting  
Propagate by cuttings or  seed. Special cultural  
techniques Remove dead f  
lowers.  
Prune back hard annually, just before new season - s growth.  
Problems  
Excess water can result in rots developing.  
Pests include thrip, aphis and mealy bug.  
Monstera Araceae  
Growing conditions  
Ideall y 21°C though relatively cold tolerant (but not frost  
tolerant). Needs well -aerated freely -draining root environment  
which is never too wet.  
High humidity is desirable but not necessary.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.0 to 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
Heavier coars e aggregates are best for both maintaining  
preferred moisture levels and giving good anchorage.  
Planting  
Propagate by layers or cuttings.  
Problems  
Relatively few except excess water in the root zone.  
Palms Palmaceae  
Growing conditions  
Ideal temperature varies according to variety though most  
prefer over 15°C, ideally over 20°C.  
Good light is important, though some shading may be needed  
in summer.  
Excellent drainage is important.   
 
Nutrient requirements  
Though palms respond to high lev els of feeding, it has been  
shown this increases the rate of metabolism and shortens  
the period they can be kept indoors.  
pH 6.0 to 7.0.  
Suitable systems  
Scoria, gravel, sand or expanded clay are most likely to suit.  
Planting  
Some palms are slow to propa gate from seed (sometimes  
taking several years to germinate).  
Special cultural techniques  
Need to be rejuvenated in a greenhouse or shadehouse  
every 1 to 3 years.  
Problems  
Pests include mealy bug, scales and mites.  
 
 
HERBS  
Basil (Sweet) Ocimum basilicum Lamiaceae  
Basil foliage is sold as a fresh -cut herb for culinary use or  
processed for the oil which is used in cosmetics, soaps and  
processed foods.  
Growing conditions  
Ideally around 20 -24°C.  
Needs continually moist but well aerated root environment.  
Needs good light conditions, although some shade may be  
needed in summer.  Nutrient requirements  
pH 5.5 to 6.5.  
Suitable systems  
Has been successful in NFT (7 -8 cm channels), scoria and  
sand/ pea t. 
Should be successful in rockwool.  
Planting  
Seed germinates in 4 to 7 day at 21°C in rockwool cubes or  
perlite. Plant out at 20 cm spacings in early spring.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellis support is needed.  
Problems  
Vigorous roots can clog NFT ch annels after a while.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest before f lowering starts.  
For the first harvest remove tips with one to two nodes.  
Side shoots will develop and a second harvest can be made  
about a month later. Further harvest can be made until mid - 
autumn when the crop is removed.  
Harvest in the morning when cool and place immediately in a  
cool place at around 5°C.  
Lemon Balm Melissa officinalis Lamiaceae  
Though not grown widely as a commercial crop, the  
lemon - f lavoured foliage is an excellent lemon substitute as a  
tea or in food processing.  
Growing conditions  
Will take full sun but prefers some shading, dry air environment  
is preferable.  
Nutrient requirements  pH 5.5 to 6.5. Will not grow at pH below 4 .5. 
Suitable systems  
Aggregate culture, NFT or rockwool should all succeed.  
 
 
Planting  
Propagates easily from seed or root division in late winter or  
early spring.  
Space at 30 -40 cm.  
Special cultural techniques  
Trellising and wind protection are necessary . 
Problems  
Foliage can turn brown if it gets wet at  
night. There are relatively few pest or  
disease problems. White f ly and aphis  
have occurred though.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Harvest in cool time of day and package in plastic to  
reduce moisture loss . 
Keep out of direct sunlight and at a low temperature to  
reduce condensation (which promotes fungal problems).  
 
 
Marjoram Origanum majorana Lamiaceae  
Sold as dried leaves for culinary purposes, or extracted oil  
which is used in cosmetics and foods. Oregano which is  
closely related (and grown similarly) is preferred for use in  
herbal medicines.  
Growing conditions  Must be well aerated but constantly mo ist around the roots.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH ideally 6.0, never below 5.0.  
Suitable systems  
NFT has been successful.  
Sand, gravel, perlite and rockwool are also recommended.  
Planting  
Seed germinates easily in about one week at 20°C.  
Problems  
Aphis may be  a problem.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Make the first cut when - ball-like-  growths appear on the  
stems. Cut back to within 3 cm of the base. The regrowth  
that occurs generally gives the best crop. Further harvests  
can also be made. Most of the oils are retained in dry leaves,  
though they should be stored in airtight containers and kept  
in the dark.  
Mint Mentha sp. Lamiaceae  
Several species are grown commercially, mainly for oil  
production. Peppermint which yields menthol is the most  
widely grown. Tho ugh generally cultivated in soil, there may be  
potential for hydroponic farming.  
Growing conditions  
Adapts well to wet conditions with medium aeration, grows well  
at mild temperatures (15°C to 20°C).  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.5 to 7.0. Will not grow at a pH level below 4.5.  
Suitable systems  
NFT has been very successful.  Planting  
Plant cuttings or divisions in late winter.  
Problems  
Common pests include cutworms, caterpillars, f lea beetles,  
aphis, mites and root weevils.  
Verticillium wilt can be a problem.  
Vigorous root system can block NFT channels. Plants should  
be replaced periodically.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Mint cut for the fresh market should be kept cool (5°C), out of  
the 
 
 
sun, and not bruised at all (this accel erates fungal damage).  
Store at 95% humidity or wrap to prevent moisture loss.  
Keep out of direct sun.

Occasionally aphis is a problem.  
Harvest and post harvest  
Cut foliage back hard periodically, and harvest growth  
periodically.  
 
 GRASS  
Fodder  
Grass and other fodder crops for animals have been grown  
successfully in hydroponic installations. Common  
agricultural practice involves grazing animals in fresh grass  
in the warmer months and feeding them with dry, cut  
fodder in the cooler months. A distinct advantage of  
hydroponic fodder is that it can be produced year round,  
giving animals fresh green food over winter.  
The protein content of some fodder varieties g rown  
hydroponically is significantly higher than when the same  
plants are gown in soil. Farmers in several countries have  
claimed an increase in milk yields from cows fed on  
hydroponic fodder.  
Depending on the animal, between 5 kg and 10 kg of fresh  
fodder will be eaten per animal per day.  
Growing conditions  
Optimum temperature depends on variety, but usually  
around 20°C to 24°C.  
Good light intensity is important.  
Nutrient requirements  
Most grasses prefer a pH of around 6.0.  
Suitable systems  
NFT -  Using wide channels (20 -30 cm), a sheet of water - 
absorbent paper is laid in the channel base to give a  
capillary -matting effect. Seed is sown on the sheet. The  
solution f low should be continuous but not so strong that it  
moves the seed. The top  of the channel remains exposed to  
light. Once the seed has germinated and grown into the  paper, the f low rate can be increased (the roots and grass  
blades will restrict the water f low, requiring an increasingly  
stronger flow rate).  
Plants can be rec ut later for more fodder.  
Progressive cropping of the same plants is an option,  
however disease can build up and f low become restricted  
to the point where a fresh sowing becomes necessary.  
Peat bed -  A shallow bed of peat can be seeded and sub - 
irrigat ed. Plants can be cut or lifted as a matted sheet for use.  
Other methods -  Most other types of aggregate bed can be  
used, though the plants must be cut. Be careful not to  
get media such as perlite or vermiculite mixed with fodder  
as these materials can  harm animals which eat them.  
Special cultural techniques  
Multi -level systems -  Fodder can be grown in several  
layers on racks in a shed or greenhouse with the use of  
artificial lights. (NB. You must use the proper wavelength  
light source, such as Grol ights.)  
Problems  
If using paper as a capillary mat, be sure it doesn - t  
contain newsprint or any other source of phytotoxic  
chemicals.  
 
 
Varieties  
The following have been grown successfully in hydroponics: oats,  
wheat, rye, barley, sorghum.  
 
Chitted Seed for Turf  Chitted seed is pre -germinated lawn seed. Hydroponic  
systems can be used to commence germination prior to  
sowing.  
This process usually t akes up to one week. Seed is removed  
from the system and sown when roots have emerged but before  
cotyledons have fully opened on most seeds.  
Growing conditions  
Depends on grass variety, but generally as for forage crops.  
Nutrient requirements  
pH 6.0.  
Nutrient solution is not needed as the seed has a store of food.  
Suitable systems  
Sprinkle a thin layer of peat, perlite or vermiculite on black  
plastic sheets on the f loor of a greenhouse in winter. Mix in grass  
seed. Water until thoroughly moist. Keep we t but not  
overwatered for 5 to 7 days then remove and sow the seed as  
you would do normally for a lawn.  
Planting  
The area can be aerated then chitted seed raked into the  
holes by the aerator.  
Seed can be spread then covered with a layer of topsoil.  
Prob lems  
Rough handling can damage seed.  
Chitted seed is extremely susceptible to drying out and dying  
with the first week following planting. It must be kept well  
watered.  
 
 
PROPAGATION/NURSE  RY PRODUCTION  
Hydroponics has been used commercially for plant  
propagation in a number of situations around the world.  
Aeroponics, rockwool propagating blocks, perlite, gravel  
culture, and even NFT have practical applications for  
striking cuttings and raising plants  for selling bare  
rooted. In some respects tissue culture (micro propagation)  
could be considered a form of hydroponic culture.  
Rockwool propagation blocks have also been successfully  
used for germinating and raising seedlings. Rockwool is first  
watere d, then seed pushed with a dibber (stick) slightly  
below the surface. There has sometimes been a problem  
though with smooth -surfaced large seed (eg. legumes). As  
the rockwool dries, it can contract, forcing larger seeds to  
the surface, where the germin ating seeds may dry out  
and die. If the blocks are kept moist and inspected  
regularly, this can be avoided.  
From time to time, successful hydroponic propagation has  
been reported in International Plant Propagation Society  
Conference Proceedings. Some i nteresting reports are  
listed below:

Other Crops  
Sholto Douglas (in Advanced Guide to Hydroponics) suggests  
the following  are well suited to propagating in hydroponics:  
cocao (Theobroma cacao), coffee (Coffea Arabica), sugar cane  
(Saccarum officinarum), runner (Hevea brasiliensis), tea  
(Camellia thea) and tobacco (Nicotina tabacum).  
He gives specific recommendations and c laims that  
frequently the quality of young plants produced is far better  
when they are started in hydroponic culture.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 16 : MANAGING A COMMERCIAL HYDROPONIC FARM   
 
 
 
Growing plants in hydroponics is one thing, but  
operating a viable hydroponic farm is  
altogether another.  
Commercial hydroponics is not just about setting up and  
operating hydroponic systems. If you are to be successful and run  a viable operation you m ust learn to do a number of other  
things:  
-  Select the right crops to grow  
-  Have a workable physical layout  
-  Manage your staff and finances properly  
-  Market your produce properly.  
DECIDING WHAT PLANTS TO GROW  
When deciding what plants to grow in a commercial hydroponics  
farm, consider the following:  
-  Ease of propagation/cost of transplants. What will it cost to  
get your initial plants (in time or money) -  If you plan to  
propagate yourself, how easy are the plants to propagate -  Are  
the plants readily available -  Is the recommended planting  
time the same as the time of year you plan to start your  
operation -  
-  How easy are these plants to grow -  Do you or your staff have  
the expertise to grow these varieties -  Difficult plants may be  
more c ostly to grow, and more risky to get a profit from, unless  
you have better than average skills.  
-  How long will the crop take to grow -  Some plants produce a  
crop ready to sell within months, others take many years.  
-  Suitability to your facilities. Do  you have the right buildings,  
equipment and other facilities to grow the particular plants  
under consideration -  Do you have the money and space to  
provide those facilities -  
-  Suitability of climate. What plants are most suitable to grow in  
your climate -  
-  Your environment. It is always more efficient to work with  
the environment rather than trying to recreate different  environments.  
-  Are other competent growers alread y producing the crop you  
would prefer to grow -  Can you establish a fair share of the  
market -  
-  Distance from potential markets. Transport is costly, and can  
be risky. What other alternatives are available -  
-  Are profits (in addition to wages) likel y to be an adequate or  
reasonable return on your investment in terms of time and  
money -  
-  The skills of your staff. Don - t try to do what you are not  
skilled to do. Someone with better skills will probably do it  
better and cheaper.  
 
 
RUNNING A CROP T RIAL  
Growers are advised to conduct a field trial before  
growing any new crop or cultivar on a commercial basis.  
Too often growers spend a lot of money, time and effort  
setting up a system only to find the crop underperforms or  
even fails. A field tria l avoids many such problems by  
allowing the grower to assess and compare different crop  
treatments on a small scale before embarking on a full - 
scale effort.  
Examples of crop trials commonly used by growers include  
trialing different crops, evaluating new cultivars, and  
comparing growing media or feeding strategies.  
 
Basics of Setting Up a Comparison Trial  
A crop trial is basically an experiment that allows t he  grower to make comparisons between different treatments.  
The treatment might be an adjustment to a nutrient  
solution, trialing a new cultivar, trying out a different  
growing medium, etc.  
The design and analysis of a meaningful crop trial will  
often  require the help of a professional horticultural  
consultant. Before setting up the trial, the grower needs  
to decide on the size of the trial and the number of  
treatments (e.g. comparisons between new cultivars or  
different levels of a nutrient) to be  tested. It is preferable to  
keep trials simple with minimal treatments to be tested.  
All plants in the trial are divided into - plots - , with each plot  
consisting of a group of plants in the same location receiving  
the same treatment. For each treatmen t tested, one  
group of plants is a control plot, which receives the  
grower - s usual management program. The other groups of  
plants also receive the identical management program,  
except for the actual treatment itself. The purpose of the  
control plot i s to enable a comparison to be made with the  
treatment plot(s).  
- Guard plants -  are placed around the outside edge of the trial  
area. Their purpose is to prevent edge effects that may  
influence growth of plots on the outside of the trial. The  
guard plants do not form a part of the trial -  they are part  
of the materials used to carry out the trial.  
Plot positions must be done randomly to exclude  
experimental bias. Bias can be introduced into an  
experiment if the grower selects conditions for  the  
treatment and control plots in a non - random fashion. A  simple way to allocate plot positions is to number the  
plots, and then use a random number generator on a hand  
calculator to allocate plots.  
 
 
Running the Trial - Records and Recording  
There are many measurements that may give valuable data,  
including solution analyses, foliar mineral analysis, plant  
height, leaf area and leaf area index (LAI), root dry weight,  
plant dry weight versus fresh weight, fruit quality assessment,  
water uptake, y ields, marketable yields, taste quality assessment,  
shelf life and photographs. There may be a number of  
characteristics that the grower wishes to assess.  
 
Evaluating the Trial  
The crop trial is evaluated by comparing the control plot  
against a treatmen t or a number of treatment plots. The  
assessment of the trial usually depends on statistical analysis  
which determines whether observed differences between control  
and experimental plots are likely to be due to real differences  
or chance occurrence.  
Replication of plants and plots is commonly used to improve  
statistical evaluation. The higher the number of replications, the  
lower the margin for error in the trial.  
In evaluating the trial, standard statistical analysis should be  
used to determine the true result of the trial. Simply looking  
at the plants and drawing a conclusion from them can be  
misleading. It is much more useful to quantify the trial by  
counting  plants and carrying out a statistical analysis of the data  in order to determine whether any observed effects are  
significant. In order to do this, the grower may need to employ  
the services of a statistician or horticultural consultant.  
 
CROP SCHEDULI NG 
Throughout the life of any crop, you will need to perform a  
number of operations. It is often helpful to break down the  
growing period into weeks, designating the tasks which are to be  
undertaken each week. Obviously the actual time of carrying  
out any task will vary a little according to the changes in the  
weather and different varieties of plant etc.  
 
Example of a Simple Flow Chart for  
Growing Lettuce  
Week 1Sow seed in 75% sand and 25% peat and place in  
greenhouse Week 2Check for germination. Ke ep well watered.  
Week 3Check for damping off, thin out if necessary.  
Spray fungicide if necessary.  
Week 4Plant seedlings into NFT channels. Spray with  
insecticide (malathion) for caterpillars etc.  
Week 5Check for insect and fungal problems. Remove  
affec ted leaves and plants, or spray.  
Week 6Treat with fungicide  
Week 7 -8 Check for disease, insect damage and  
nutrient deficiencies.  
Week 9Harvest.  
Obviously some crops involve more work -  pruning, changing  
nutrient solutions, shading, temperature control, staking, etc. Any  
such tasks should be included in a f low chart. This type of  analysis  
 
 
of the crops - s life will help you plan your producti on. 
 
 
STANDARDS  
A hydroponic farm, like any business, must set and  
adhere to certain standards if it is going to operate profitably.  
These standards can be broken down into three main groups:  
1. Cost of efficiency standards  
2. Quality standards  
3. Quanti ty standards  
Cost Efficiency  
There must be a sound relationship between the cost of  
production and sales price. Both of these monetary figures must  
be constantly monitored and maintained at an acceptable level so  
as to ensure profitability in the busine ss. 
Cost of Production + Profit = Sales price  
If the cost of production gets too high, profit will decrease.  
In such a situation, the sales price must be increased, or else  
the profit figure can become a minus amount (i.e. you might be  
losing money rath er than making it).  
In order to control your cost effectiveness, you must be aware,  
and in control of all factors which influence the cost of  
production.  
Cost of production  
Cost of production is influenced by the following factors:  
-  Cost of site (lease/rent value)  -  Cost of site services (power, gas, water, insurance, rates, etc)  
-  Cost of materials (soil, fertilisers, etc)  
-  Cost of unsold produce -  a certain proportio n may be lost,  
may die, or may just become unsaleable. (Some horticultural  
businesses budget for as much as 30% of stock being thrown  
away.)  
-  Labour costs (be sure to include your own time as well  
as employees).  
-  Advertising promotion (printing, ad vertising in magazines,  
etc.)  
-  Selling costs (transportation, invoicing, etc.)  
-  Taxation (don - t forget payroll tax, income tax, etc.)  
Profit  
This figure should be over and above money which you earn as  
wages. If you are only working for wages (with no profit), then  
you would be better off putting your money into some  
different form of investment and going to work for someone else.  
Profit should be greater than the interest rate which you  
could get by investing your money elsewhere. Profit should  
normally be at least 15 -20%. In horticultural businesses the  
profit margin can vary greatly from crop to crop and year to  
year. You will find that profit will be very low (possibly  
nothing) some years, and high other years.  
The profit must be viewed in term of an average over several  
years. New operations should always have sufficient liquidity  
to carry them over if they have a couple of bad seasons before  
some good seasons come along.  
Sales price  
  
The figure which produc e is sold for can vary  
considerably. This can due to such factors as overall  
economic conditions, general availability of the product  
you are selling, and consumer demand.  
 
Quality Standards  
The following factors are of concern when considering  
produce  quality:  
-  General appearance of vigour or health such as markings  
or lack of markings (e.g. disease, rot, bruising, etc.)  
-  Taste or smell (e.g. how sweet or bitter)  
-  Freshness (i.e. the quicker you can sell it after harvest,  
the better the quality  will be).  
Quantity Standards  
Commercial production must achieve certain standards  
in terms of the quantity of produce being harvested, its  
weight and the size of each individual unit (e.g. how  
many strawberries will you pick per year per square  
metre,  and how big will each strawberry be).  
-  For some crops, the size is not critical but the number is  
(e.g. orchids are sold on the number of flowers. A slightly  
smaller or larger flower will not make a great deal of  
difference to the cost).  
-  For other crops, weight is critical, but size doesn - t matter  
(e.g. beans are sold by the kilogram, irrespective of  
whether they are large or small beans).  
-  For other crops size and weight are both important (e.g.  
strawberr ies are sold by the kilogram, but large ones are  sold at a different rate from small ones).  
 
 
HYDOPONICS FARM LAYOUT  
A well laid out system will be more efficient, less costly to  
operate in terms of manpower and will return greater profits. It  
is essent ial that equipment, materials, and people are able to  
move easily from one area to another. To achieve this you  
should do the following:  
-  Study the work operations which take place.  
-  Identify movements that occur the most (e.g. People and  
equipment may move from the store room to the nutrient  
tanks more frequently than from the nutrient tanks to the  
packing sheds).  
-  Design the farm in a way that makes movement easiest along  
the paths which are used the most (e.g. Nutrient tanks should  
be closer  to the store than to the packing sheds).  
-  There are three aspects to work carried out on any  
hydroponics farm: growing, harvesting and marketing. These  
three areas should be segregated as much as possible.  
Good layout decisions based on the above prin ciples are as  
follows:  
-  Tools, equipment and chemicals used in production should be  
kept away from the marketing side of the operation.  
-  Delivery vehicles should have easy access to the property,  
and deliveries should be able to be made as close as possible  
to store rooms or sheds.  
-  Delivery vans, staff cars and vehicles transporting produce  
should have restricted access to the prop erty. In general, these  vehicles not only take up space, but they bring disease into the  
property, as well as being a security problem. Consequently,  
loading and unloading bays are best situated close to the front  
of the property.  
-  Post -harvest opera tions including sorting, grading, packing  
and storage should be done under cover to protect produce,  
and should be located within easy reach of the crop. It should  
be possible to move produce into this area quickly and easily  
after harvest.  
-  Concrete  or asphalt pathways and floors should be used in  
areas where wheeled tools or equipment are to be used or  
areas which must remain clean (e.g. a path leading to a  
greenhouse should preferably be sealed to keep shoes clean  
and reduce the chance of disea se being carried into the  
house).  
-  Potentially dangerous situations should not be allowed (e.g.  
objects protruding into work areas and access tracks -   
overhead objects should not be so low to restrict clear  
access).  
 
 
Design of a Store  
A storeroom o r storage shed must be accessible from  
other parts of the farm, be secure and have an interior  
design which allows for easy access to stores.  
-  Both expensive and dangerous items can be stored on a  
farm. The store should be securely locked and there  
should be a limit on staff who have free access.  
-  Doors of small stores should open out allowing better  access inside.  
-  Pesticides or other dangerous chemicals should be  
stored in a separate lock -up cupboard or room. This is  
often required by law. There may also be legal  
obligations to place danger signs on such storage areas.  
-  It is preferable that all equipment and materials, where  
practical, be stored on racks or shelves, off the ground  
(for cleanliness), and properly labelled where necessary.  
 
 
MARKETING YOUR PRODUCE  
Marketing takes in everything involved in the process of  
taking your produce to the final customer. If you are to mar ket  
your produce well, you need to understand all the steps in this  
process, and make sure each step is done as well as  
possible.  
Typical steps in marketing are:  
-  Packaging and storing the produce -  this affects its  
attractiveness to potential buyer s and its longevity.  
-  Transporting the produce.  
-  Promoting the produce.  
-  Selling.  
Considering Your Markets  
Hydroponic produce, whether fruit, vegetables or cut f lowers, is  
generally sold through one of the following:  
1. Direct sales to the public  
(e.g. from the packing shed on your property, or from a  
roadside stall). Some growers have supplemented their  
income by tapping the tourist market and catering in other  ways to p eople visiting their property. It may be viable to  
consider setting up conducted tours of a hydroponic farm  
together with direct sales of produce, and perhaps a shop  
selling souvenirs, refreshments etc.  
Some such operations may involve - pick your own -  sales  
where the public pays a bargain price for what they pick  
themselves. This has been done commercially with NFT  
strawberries in Australia.  
2. Sales through major markets  
Major cities operate fruit, vegetable and cut -flower markets  
through which gr owers sell produce to shopkeepers. You can  
hire a stand or sell through an agent (who generally takes a  
commission) at such markets.  
3. Selling direct to retail outlets  
It may be viable for you to do your own distribution  
with some crops, and if you are  big enough to make it  
worthwhile. Distribution can be expensive and time  
consuming though, and should not be tackled lightly.  
4. Contract growing  
Some companies will contract produce to be grown for  
processing in factories. Generally the price paid for  produce is  
predetermined, limiting the mount of profit which the grower  
may make, but giving a guaranteed sale.  
 
Market Research  
One of the major keys to success in any business is to  
- know your market - . If you know that there is demand for what  
you are planning to grow, and if you can pinpoint where that  
demand is, your chance of success will increase greatly (not to  mention the sleepless nights you will save). So one of the most  
important things you can do before growing any new crop is to  
thoroughly research the market.  
Successful marketing depends upon knowing the  
people/groups you are marketing to -  what they want, how  
they are likely to react to your product, what they wi ll spend  
money on etc. When the  
 
 
market place is understood, you can then follow the steps  
below to achieve successful marketing:  
-  Set realistic marketing goals  
-  Provide structures for reaching those goals  
-  Assess the results of marketing efforts and modify your  
approaches accordingly  
Market research involves all those activities which help  
management reach marketing decisions. It attempts to make  
the unknown known; and in most instances, largely  
succeeds.  
Steps involved in market research  
What  information is required -  If there is a problem, define it.  
For example, how can I increase sales by 10% -  - .. or  
should I change the way I distribute my produce -  
-  Conduct the investigation. Examine past records which  
relate to the problem. Speak with people in the know,  
who might help with this problem. Try to find any  
relevant information which has been published (e.g. in  
trade magazines, bureau of statistic s etc).  
-  If more information is required, you may decide to  survey the customers (or potential customers). Note: this  
involves significantly more cost.  
-  If the problem is still beyond you, you may employ a  
professional market research firm to handle  it. 
Gathering information  
There are various ways you can obtain information about  
the market. After considering the possible marketing  
avenues (e.g. direct sales to the public, selling through major  
markets, contract growing etc.), and the type of prod uce  
you might grow; you should next try to find out all you can  
about the market you are considering. Get to know the  
details of how that market operates, what your chances  
might be of breaking into that market and how strong it is.  
This information c an be gathered in three main ways: asking  
questions, observing people and referring to literature.  
1. Asking people (i.e. surveys)  
Formal or informal, surveys can tell you a lot about a  
market. Surveys are relatively inexpensive and  
adaptable to a wide variety of situations. Questions are  
asked through personal interviews, mail questionnaires,  
telephone interviews etc.  
-  Mail and telephone surveys are less expensive  
-  Telephone surveys produce quickest results  
-  Personal interviews are the most accurate  
2. Watching people  
Much can be learnt by observing people in the market  
place. Visit a fruit or f lower shop and watch what they  
buy, what produce they are attracted to, and how they  
buy. This involves observ ing reactions when something  is presented to people. Some growers get excellent  
feedback from the public when they put on a  
promotional display at an agricultural or trade show.  
The main disadvantage is that observations may not be  
accurate.  
3. Litera ture  
Magazines, newspapers and books are a great source  
of information. They can give a very good indication of  
what markets are most viable; however, literature  
is not always up to date. Material published today  
may have been written  
 
 
months or years  ago, and may not be an accurate  
reflection of the situation. Newspapers and monthly  
magazines are generally better than quarterly journals  
or books.  
 
What Do You Need To Research -  
In any business, success is determined by a combination of many  
factor s, and different factors are relevant in different situations.  
However, the following areas are commonly researched:  
-  Progressive or backward (Is the market for your proposed  
produce expanding or contracting - ) 
-  Is the competition helpful and courteous to customers - or  
not-  
-  Does the competition give quick and efficient service -  
-  Is the produce you have in mind advertised/promoted  
well or poorly in the marketplace -  -  Is the produce you are considering  inexpensive or expensive -  
How to Sell Successfully  
Whether you sell direct to the public or only deal with  
contractors or agents, you will find some basic sales skills can be  
invaluable. Often your ability to sell is the difference between a  
successfu l hydroponic business and financial disaster. When you  
negotiate a sale, be prepared and make sure you know the  
following:  
-  Details of what you are selling; its attributes, its competition,  
its negative points (and how to counteract these).  
-  Where a nd how to find the  
product/brochures/catalogues/order forms - or anything  
else relating to the sale.  
-  The prices to charge and terms of sale.  
-  Procedure for making a sale (including using cash register,  
filling out order book, writing receipt etc).  
-  Company policies (on returns, damaged goods etc).  
-  How to package and deliver goods or services (e.g.  
wrapping, directing other staff to deliver service or goods  
etc).  
-  How to keep records in order.  
-  How to maintain order and tidiness in sales ar ea/equipment  
etc. 
Key Rules Every Salesperson Should Follow  
-  Research your customer and product first. (You need to know  
both the customer and the product before you attempt to  
sell).  
-  Find out everything your customer needs to buy before you  
start dealing.  -  Highlight the benefits of a product rather that the features. (Tell  
the customer what it can do for him personally - don- t tell him  
what is great and unique about the product  if it is not relevant  
to him in particular.)  
-  If there are objections, play it cool and try to determine very  
specifically what they are -  once you narrow down the  
objection, put it into perspective by showing something about  
the product which comp ensates for that objection (e.g. yes it is  
expensive -  but it will sell better).  
-  Always keep control of the conversation -  don- t let yourself get  
into a defensive position. This is done by asking questions  
when the customer starts to take the offe nsive.  
-  Do not talk while showing the product. Show them and then  
stop and talk, stop talking while you show them again - etc. 
 
 
-  Handle produce with respect.  
-  Get the customer to try out the product (e.g. give him a  
strawberry to eat or a flower to  smell).  
-  If you need to, use the phone or calculator to buy  
thinking time (excuse yourself to make a phone call or  
calculate some figures).  
-  Try to close the sale -  ask for an order at the appropriate  
time, when the customer seems to be in a state of mind  
where he/she is likely to buy. (Many a good sale is lost  
because the salesman doesn - t close the deal when he has  
the chance. Once you and the customer part ways, the  
chances of getting back togeth er to finalise the deal are  
greatly reduced).  -  Remember that fulfilling the customer - s needs is more  
important than improving your own knowledge or sales  
technique.  
-  Do not forget that the customer is always right; without  
him you are not going to  remain in business.  
 
 
CHAPTER 17 : TROUBLESHOOTING: A GUIDE TO OVERCOMING  
 PROBLEMS IN HYDROPONICS By Lynette Morgan   
 
 
 
NUTRIENT LEVELS  
Hydroponic systems are reliant on the composition and  
formulation of the nutrient solution to supply all the essentia l  
elements required for optimal plant growth and yields. However,  
nutrient solutions are complex and the composition of these  
changes as they f low through the root system and irons are  
extracted. Many problems in hydroponic systems are either  
nutrien t or environmentally based, making these the main areas  
where troubleshooting skills need to be developed.  
The most common nutrient problem is the development of  
deficiencies of one or more elements, either due to rapid  
uptake or unsuitable nutrient formulations and management,  
which are common mistakes made by many hydroponic  
growers.  
Deficiencies in hydroponic production are more common than  
toxicities as plant uptake of many elements has the potential  
to strip out nutrients at a rapid rate, particularly from  recirculating solutions. The most common deficiency problems in  
hydroponic crops are potassium in fruiting plants such as  
tomatoes, iron under certain environmental conditions, nitrogen  
in some highly vegeta tive crops, and calcium in many species  
such as lettuce, tomatoes and capsicum.  
To complicate hydroponic plant nutrition further,  
deficiencies as they occur in different crops may or may not be a  
result of an actual deficiency in the nutrient solution.  
Potassium can certainly be stripped from a nutrient solution  
rapidly as fruit develop and expand, and also because luxury  
uptake occurs in many crops. However iron, calcium and  
magnesium deficiencies on leaves and fruit occur even when  
there is more t han sufficient of these elements in solution.  
These induced deficiencies often fool growers into thinking  
there is a problem with the formulation of their nutrient, when  
the cause is often more complex.  
Iron 
Iron deficiency is common under cool growing conditions, where  
the root system might have become saturated, damaged or  
where the pH is running high.  
Magnesium  
Magnesium deficiency on crops such as tomatoes can be  
induced by high levels of potassium uptake.  
Calcium  
Calcium deficiency which shows as tip burn on lettuce and  
blossom end rot of tomatoes and peppers is a calcium transport  
problem within the plant, rather than a lack of calcium in the  
solution. It is induced by environmental conditions such as high  
hum idity which restricts transpiration and calcium  distribution.  
 
 
Solutions  
Working out if deficiency symptoms on a crop are actual  
or induced by other factors becomes the vital first step to  
solving such problems. The simplest way for a grower to  
determ ine this is to have a full solution or leachate analysis  
carried out to rule out any deficiency in the plant - s feed  
regime. Low levels of an element in solution (below the  
optimum being aimed for) certainly indicate that the  
nutrient is the problem an d boosting levels of the deficient  
element will rapidly help correct the situation. Some  
deficiencies, particularly of the trace elements such as iron,  
benefit from foliar application of these nutrients to help  
correct the problem in the short term. Th ese however are  
only a quick fix and the missing nutrient needs to be  
supplied in the root zone at the correct levels over the long  
term. Iron foliar sprays are particularly effective where  
cool conditions or root zone damage have limited iron  
uptake and caused the distinctive iron chlorosis symptoms  
on the new leaves.  
 
 
SALT BUILDUP AND EC PROBLEMS  
Salt or nutrient buildup/crusting is often seen in hydroponic  
systems, particularly in crops grown over a long season or with  
media used for several years. Salt buildup appears as  
white/off - white crystalline crusts or residues on the surface  of growing media and sometimes even on the base of plant stems  
where it  can cause salt burn damage.  
Certain types of media are more prone to this nutrient  
problem than others -  those with porous structures and high  
rates of water loss from the substrate are more prone to salt  
crusting than others. Expanded clay granules a nd similar media  
often develop a whitish coating on the surface after a few months  
use, and this can be common in ebb and flow systems. Media beds  
which are covered with plastic film -  as in the case of rockwool  
slabs -  rarely develop these salt depo sits on the surface as the  
film prevents excessive moisture loss from the media which  
results in salt buildup.  
Salt buildup occurs when a medium which has been thoroughly  
wetted with nutrient solution containing dissolved salts, loses  
moisture to evapo ration faster than the minerals are taken  
up by the plant - s root system. In this case the moisture is lost to  
the atmosphere but the minerals stay behind, thus increasing the  
EC in the media and around the roots. This salt buildup in the  
root zone can  cause damage both through direct contact with the  
salt crystals around the delicate plant stem, particularly in  
seedlings, and by increasing the osmotic pressure around the  
plant roots.  
Fortunately salt buildup is easily dealt with once growers  
recognise the symptoms -  white crusting is the first sign, as is  
plant growth which becomes stunted, dark, hard and unusually  
slow. As salt accumulation becomes more severe, the stem  
area at the base of the plant and roots can be burnt and die  
back, r esulting in wilting during the warmer times of day and, as  
the problem progresses, disease attack in these areas.  Regular monitoring of the EC of the nutrient solution  
draining from the media helps prevent and diagnose salt  
accumulation problems -  idea lly the EC of the feed solution  
should not increase as it f lows through the root system. If the  
EC is increasing as its f lows through the root system and out  
the base of the growing container, then salt build is likely to  
occur. However, even plants fed a low EC solution can develop  
salt accumulation where the atmosphere is dry and high rates of  
water loss from a porous medium occur. In this case, the  
medium will benefit from some leaching from time to time and  
a thorough clean between crops (or e ven replacement in  
severe cases). Some growers prefer to leach excess salts from the  
growing medium using plain water; however when an actively  
growing crop is present this can have negative effects as the  
sudden drop in osmotic pressure in the root zo ne triggers a  
large influx of moisture into the root cells which can in turn  
result in fruit splitting and soft, weak vegetative growth. Flushing  
growing media with either a specifically designed - f  
lushing solution -  or a 1/3 strength nutrient is rec ommended to  
remove excess salts from the root zone. Carrying this process out  
every few weeks may be required in certain hydroponic systems,  
such as shallow f lood and drain or tray systems in warm climates  
with high evapotranspiration rates, and often  between crops  
if media is to be reused.  
 
 
SODIUM TOXICITY AND  
ACCUMULATION  
One of the most problematic elements in hydroponic  nutrient solutions is sodium. Many large hydroponic  
installations must rely on ground water sources, many of  
which naturally contain sodium and other undesirable  
elements. Oceanic countries and regions often have high  
sodium levels in bore and rain water and this can  
become a major problem in recirculat ing systems and  
even in drain -to-waste media systems as it tends to  
accumulate rapidly under conditions of high evaporation  
and transpiration. Plants don - t require large levels of  
sodium, thus the levels of this element build up in the  
solution or me dia until it is dumped and replaced. Dumping  
of the solution is a costly, time -consuming process which is  
not seen as environmentally friendly, particularly where the  
solution contains sodium accumulation. However, some  
crops and systems are more toler ant of sodium levels in the  
water supply and avoiding growing sodium -sensitive  
crops is often advised where high levels of this element  
are continually present.  
Accumulation of undesirable elements such as sodium in  
recirculating nutrient solutions are  dependant on the  
original composition of the water source, since more and  
more of this element will be added each time the water  
is topped up. While it may take some time until an element  
such as sodium builds up to toxic levels, it does cause the  
problem of adding to the EC level of the solution. For  
example, if an EC of 2.0 is being maintained,  
0.4 - 0.5 units of this could be due to sodium, thus  
reducing the levels of macro and micro elements  
available to the plant, while still providing the same  osmotic pressure. For this reason, it is essential that  
growers know the sodium content of their water supply  
and the rate at which this accumulates in recirculating  
solutions.  
Much resea rch has been carried out on the effects of sodium  
in solution on fruiting crops such as tomatoes, which are  
fairly salt tolerant, but little information is available on more  
sensitive crops such as lettuce. Recommendations as to the  
maximum allowable l evels of sodium in solution, and at  
what point crop yield and quality losses occur due to the  
build up of this element are not clear and often vary  
considerably. In recirculating systems, levels as low as 50  
ppm of sodium can have a negative effect on growth of  
crops such as lettuce, herbs, salad greens, strawberries,  
roses and a few other cut f lower crops. More salt  
tolerant crops such as tomatoes can withstand sodium  
levels in excess of 250 ppm, before any negative effect  
occurs. If sodium, bein g a non -essential element, is  
continually introduced via the water supply, it will continue  
to build up unless the solution is bled or dumped from  
the system.  
Sodium is toxic for certain processes in the plant. In the  
foliage, it reduces photosynthesis  and enzyme reactions,  
however, plants do have the ability to block sodium  
absorption into the leaf. Research in the Netherlands has  
shown that in capsicum plants, grown in a solution  
containing relatively high levels of sodium, a large  
proportion of the sodium in the above - ground part of the  
plant is very efficiently withdrawn from the transpiration  stream into the stem pith. This protects the leaf processes  
and also leads to low sodium levels in the fruit. However the  
sodium which becomes stored in the stem pith seems to  
leach back out of the plant if the feed solution is replaced  
by a low sodium solution. This leads to a salt increase in  
the feed solution, indicating that it is best to replace  
only a portion of the nutrient solution several times, than  
to completely dump and replace with fresh solution. It is  
known  
 
 
that plants can adapt to gradually increasing salinity of a nutrient  
solution, however some species have a greater ability to do this  
than others. It has also been found that the addition of soluble  
silica to nutrient solutions provides some protection against  
potentially toxic levels of sodium. The best option for growers  
using water which contains sodium is to monitor the build up  
of this element in recirculating nutrient solutions or nutrient  
leachate from media systems and use this information to decide  
how often the solution must be totally or partially replaced to  
prevent accumulation of plant dama ging levels. In some cases,  
reverse osmosis needs to be used to remove excess ions from a  
water supply before it is useable for hydroponic nutrient  
solutions and top up water.  
 
WHEN NUTRIENTS GO BAD  
The nutrient solution in hydroponic systems provides an ideal  
environment for a number of other forms of life to grow and  
multiply. Plant life such as algae is common, and microbial  populations exist in most healthy nutrient solutions unless some  
form of sterilisation is used. Nematodes, insects such as mosquito  
larvae and others, can proliferate in some nutrients and may  
cause plant growth problems. Nutrient solutions provide the  
ideal breeding ground for many plant pathogenic fungi and  
bacteria si nce they contain mineral elements, usually some  
organic matter, moisture and are often warmed to just the right  
temperature for optimum microbial growth. Bacteria, fungi and  
algae are also very commonly carried in water supplies, on  
media, seedlings an d old root systems, on equipment,  
transported by humans, animals, wind and in dust, making  
complete avoidance difficult. Despite this, most well run  
hydroponic systems don - t often have problems with odour,  
bacterial growth or insects, but when they do  establish, control  
needs to be swift as certain nutrient problems will rapidly cause  
root death and plant decline.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
ALGAE  
Most hydroponic growers come across algae sooner or later.  
It appears as a green, brown, reddish or black, slimy growth  
which clings to channels, gullies and pumps or spreads  over the surface of damp media. Long strings of algae  
are common in nutrient tanks and return channels and  
the speed at which this form of plant life can grow and  
multiply is often impressive. Algae usually has an earthy or  
mouldy smell, and large volumes of decomposing algae in  
the nutrient can be responsible for unpleasant odours.  
Algae is a nuisance to any grower as it not only looks   
unsightly, but has the ability to block drippers, emitter,  
pumps, return channels, filters and heavy growth can even  
seal off the surface of growing substrates, robbing the roots  
of oxygen.  
The problem with algae, apart from the appearance and  
smell problems it can create, is not so much that it competes  
for nutrients with plant roots, but as it blooms, dies and  
decomposes, it sucks up dissolved oxygen from the system.  
This increases the biological oxygen demand (BOD) on the  
system and causes root  suffocation from a lack of oxygen.  
Decomposing algae may also release toxins as it breaks  
down and provides a food source for plant pathogenic fungi  
which may then multiply to high levels in the system. Algae  
directly attached to plant root systems ca n suffocate the  
roots, making the plants prone to attack by opportunist  
pathogens such as Pythium.  
Algae, is a form of plant life, and it is a natural consequence  
of exposing water with nutrients dissolved in it to a  
light source. Where there is no light, algae cannot grow, so  
the best solution to preventing algae growth is to stop light  
from reaching the nutrient solution where ever possible.  
Channels should ha ve light -proof covers; return gullies  also benefit from covers; large media beds can also be  
covered with either plastic film or a layer of substrate which  
is designed to act as a - dry mulch -  since algae can not  
grow on dry surfaces.  
In aeroponic sys tems, the root chamber must be light proof  
and media pot or container systems can use plastic or  
rigid collars which cover the surface of the media. Plastic  
collars are available these days for rockwool  
propagation cubes -  a surface which is usually g reen  
with algae by the time seedlings are ready for planting.  
However, even in the best designed system, there is  
usually somewhere that light will fall on the nutrient -   
planting holes in NFT, return outlets in channels and tanks  
are common areas.  
Control of algae, once established in a hydroponic system  
can be difficult -  most growers tolerate small amounts of  
algae in the systems provided it does not become  
excessive. A regular scrub out between crops will often  
remove stubborn algae and is of ten the only control used  
by commercial growers.  
Some growers do add algaecide products into the  
nutrient to kill off algae and there are a number of these  
products on the market. However, since any product which  
kills algae, a form of plant life, can also damage young or  
sensitive root systems, care must be taken with the dose  
as damage has been known to occur. Algae will also  
regrow very quickly after applications of most algaecide  
products, requiring regular  applications to maintain good  
control.  Hydrogen peroxide can also be added to the nutrient  
solution to kill of existing algae. However it has been found  
that dose levels of 50ppm of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is  
required to control algae, a rate which w as phytotoxic  
for young plants, although older  
 
 
plants survived this dose rate. Therefore careful and selective  
use of H2O2 could be used on older, more resistant plants, but  
since H2O2 is a biocide rather than just an algaecide, there is  
always a ris k of root damage.  
 
ROOT DEATH  
The major causes of root death in hydroponics are suffocation,  
starvation, pathogens, chemical damage, temperatures and  
EC/pH problems. In hydroponics, suffocation is probably the  
leading cause of root death and reduced gro wth rates. Often, any  
pathogens present won - t attack a healthy root system until it is  
damaged or weakened by adverse conditions -  usually  
stagnation or suffocation in the root zone.  
A lack of oxygen can be caused by f looding or ponding of the  
nutri ent solution, decomposing organic matter in the  
solution, slow f low rates, and too many plants robbing  
oxygen from the root zone, which is accelerated as  
conditions become warmer. A lack of oxygen reduces the  
permeability of roots to water and toxins will accumulate as the  
root cells die. Some plants such as tomatoes, will attempt to  
adapt to the lack of oxygen by producing adventitious roots on  
the low er stem and swelling at the stem base.   
STARVATION  
A lack of nutrients will affect the root system just as it does  
the top of the plant. However, the symptoms are more difficult to  
observe. A phosphate deficiency will cause the roots to become  
brown wit h a reduced number of lateral branches. A lack of  
calcium will induce a thin, poorly developed, brown root system.  
Manganese deficiency will cause a small root system that is much  
shorter and finer than usual with some browning of the root tips.  
Copper  deficiency results in severe underdevelopment of the root  
zone. Boron deficiency causes the root tips to become jelly -like in  
appearance.  
 
SANITATION  
Many products and chemicals that are used to sanitise  
hydroponic systems and equipment between crops a re effective  
at killing pathogens. However, residues of these chemicals that  
aren - t completely washed away before the seedlings are  
planted can cause a number of problems, including root death.  
For example, chlorine is a common sanitation agent, but i t can  
burn off young roots -  even at low concentrations -  so care must  
be taken to rinse off all traces of chlorine before replanting the  
systems. Hydrogen peroxide at levels as low as 7ppm has  
been shown to damage the root system of young lettuce  
plants and should be used with care.  
 
 
EC AND PH  
An electrical conductivity (EC) level that is too high for the  crop being grown will result in severe stunting of the root  
system. If the EC reaches e xtreme levels, water will be  
lost from the root cells back into the nutrient solution to  
the point where root death will occur. This is more common  
in crops that prefer a lower EC level such as lettuce.  
Likewise, pH levels that are too high or low can i nduce root  
damage and nutrient uptake problems. However the pH  
range that plants can tolerate without any negative effects  
is fairly large. It has been found that the appearance of the  
root system differs in hydroponic plants that have been  
grown at d ifferent pH levels. Plants grown at a pH of 7.5  
and above have a shorter, coarser root system than those  
grown at a pH of 5.5. Higher pH levels reduce the availability  
of certain elements in solution, mostly iron and  
manganese, and may induce deficienc y symptoms.  
 
NUTRIENT TEMPERATURE  
Often, a brief period of cold or heat will stress and  
damage the root system. However root regeneration is  
usually rapid when conditions improve again. For example, if  
hydroponic strawberry plants are chilled, most of t he root  
system will become blackened and may die. But when  
conditions warm up again as the plant is put into a  
heated greenhouse, healthy white roots emerge from the  
base of the crown. Also, a nutrient solution that is too  
cold or too warm will result in a root system that doesn - t  
fully extend. The roots will remain stunted since the root  
tips don - t want to grow into the solution. High or low  
temperatures in the root zone also stress the plant and  reduce the rate of nutrient and water uptake. This stress  
also weakens the plants, making attack by root pathogens  
more likely.  
 
 
ROOT PATHOGENS  
Root diseases are a major concern for hydroponic growers. This  
is parti cularly true of growers who use NFT and other  
recirculating systems that could quickly transport pathogens  
to a large number of plants. Some pathogens that can attack  
roots in hydroponic systems have symptoms that make them  
easy to identify with some p ractice. However, others may not  
have any symptoms at all. One aspect these pathogens all have  
in common is their ability to reduce plant growth and yield.  
Detection kits are available for many root -attacking pathogens.  
Also, sample tissue can be sent for correct identification to a  
number of facilities. But for most growers, examining the root  
zone is the first line of defence against root pathogens.  
The most common pathogens that effect roots in hydroponic  
production are Pythium, Phytophthora, Fusa rium, Olpidium,  
Plasmopara, Didymella and Verticillium. Others have also been  
reported to cause crop losses -  in fact about 20 fungal, four  
viral and two bacterial pathogens exist that are commonly  
associated with root diseases in hydroponic vegetable crops.  
Root pathogens can infect hydroponic crops from a  
number of sources, including air, water, media, insects, infected  
plant material, seeds and dust. Airborne root pathogens are  
rare, but have b een known to occur. A more common source  
of infection is soil, which hosts a huge number of inoculum.  Soil can enter a hydroponics system on the shoes of staff, as  
dust in the air, in media, on equipment, or in water,  
particularly from exposed sources such as reservoirs, rivers and  
streams. Also insects such as shore f lies and fungus gnats can  
carry pathogens.  
Since many root problems and odd symptoms are caused by  
pathogens, and such attack is often induced by stressed plants,  
cultivating a health y crop is always a growers first line of  
defence. Ensuring adequate oxygen is present in the root zone  
throughout the hydroponic system is essential. Sometimes  
environmental or cultural problems exist that stress the plants  
without the grower - s knowle dge. Therefore observing the root  
zone on a regular basis is vitally important. In media -based  
systems, a grower who notices a plant showing signs of wilt  
or discoloration should pull it out and examine the root  
system. Once any plant has been identifi ed as potentially  
having a root disease, it should be removed from the  
cropping area and destroyed. Proper sanitation and hygiene in  
hydroponic systems is also important for pathogen control. Root  
pathogens can carry over from one crop to the next and any  
media or substrate that contained infected plants should be  
discarded. In areas where there are high populations of root  
disease pathogens, commercial growers need to consider some  
form of control such as treating the water supply with UV light,  
hydrogen peroxide or ozone.  
 
 
FRUITING  
PROBLEMS IN  HYDROPONICS  
Fruiting crop problems in hydroponics can range from a  
simple lack of fruit development to more complex  
physiological disor ders such as blossom end rot (BER).  
Many growers have experienced fruit with skin disorders  
such as uneven coloration, blotch, crazing, streaking,  
silvering and other unidentified spots. Fruit splitting can be  
common in crops such as tomatoes. Capsicum s and  
cucumber can become grossly misshapen. These disorders  
are largely physiological, environmental and cultural.  
 
Flower and Fruitlet Drop  
Most common hydroponic crops will f lower when they  
have reached their appropriate point in development. One  
frequent problem is f lower drop. There are many potential  
causes of f lower and fruitlet drop in hydroponic crops -   
some are internal and caused by plant stress and some  
are environmental. In many crops, f lower drop in induced  
by high air temperature s. However the point at which this  
thermal stress occurs varies for each crop and cultivar. Low  
light levels that limit the growth of the whole plant can  
also induce drop, particularly where low light is  
combined with high temperatures. Although not as  common  
in hydroponic crops as those grown in soil, mineral  
deficiencies, such as low levels of nitrogen and/or  
phosphorus (P) in the nutrient solution, can retard f lower  
and fruit development and cause drop. Flower drop can  
also be caused by water stress -  either a lack of irrigation  
or high EC levels.  With the development of high -yielding greenhouse  
cultivars, another major cause of f lower and fruitlet drop  
has beco me heavy fruit load or excessive vegetative growth.  
Young, newly developed leaves compete for assimilates  
with the f lowers and fruitlets already on the plant. If  
assimilates are transported to these new leaves at the  
expense of the f lowers, drop can occur. This is more  
common in situations where assimilate production is  
limited due to low light or other reasons. Lowering plant  
density, use of carbon dioxide and cultivars less prone to  
drop assists growers to prevent these types of problems  
which often occur in winter. The presence of a heavy fruit  
load developing on the plant has the same effect -  new f  
lowers and fruitlets may be sacrificed in favour of the rapidly  
developing, larger fruit already present. In certain crops  
a lack of pollinat ion may be the cause of f lower and more  
commonly, fruitlet drop.
